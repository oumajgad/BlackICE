EVTNAME33505;Japan decides desperate measures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33505;It seems our last advances against Japan have impressed their General Staff. The enemy is raising dozens of fresh divisions to protect its mainland. Invading Japan could became a nightmare, even though these troops are mostly ill-equipped and untrained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33508;The 2nd Shanghai incident, as known as "Battle of Shanghai" was the first major engagement fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war.

EVTNAME33509;2nd Shanghai Incident (August 9th, 1937) - Historical outcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33509;The 2nd Shanghai incident, as known as "Battle of Shanghai" was the first major engagement fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war. On August 9th, an incident at the Hongqiao Airport heightened the tensions between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the Shanghai International Settlement. Japan began sending in reinforcements to Shanghai asking for a total withdrawal of Chinese forces in the area.\n A fierce three-month battle ensued, involving more than 70 divisions (700,000 men) on the Chinese side facing 9 Japanese divisions supported by planes, tanks, heavy artillery and ships from the 3rd Fleet, totalling 300,000 men. Japan made amphibious landings on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay to support its isolated garrison in Shanghai.\nThe Chinese soldiers had to rely primarily on small-caliber weapons in their defense of Shanghai, against an overwhelming Japanese onslaught of air, naval, and armored striking power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, while also failing to elicit any international intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33510;Battle of Shanghai is raging...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Remaining units of the 2nd Tank Division were reassigned to the Japanese 14th Area Army, and sent to the Philippines in August 1944. They were almost destroyed in the Battle of Luzon. The 2nd Tank Division was reconstituted in Japan as a training unit after the disaster in the Philippines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Nevertheless, the division lacked both infantry and self-propelled gun regiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33638;Formation of SNLF brigades in 1937.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33638;Following the escalation of hostilities in Shanghai in August 1937, the Navy organized additional SNLF battalions, which were often raised for a specific task and then disbanded.\nIn addition to the Shanghai SNLF, three other SNLF from this period remained active throughout the war.

EVTDESC33647;The Manchukuo Imperial Army, armed force of the Japanese State of Manchukuo made large use of cavalry brigades for border and local security duties.\nA typical Manchurian cavalry brigade was composed of a headquarters, three cavalry regiments, and an artillery company, for a total of 1,500 men and 1,500 horses.\n\n§RHere you can receive a whole Manchurian Cavalry Corps as an expeditionnary force.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Soviet forces from the Amur Flotilla started to unload troops on Kanchazu Island located in the center of the river, crossing the official frontier between Manchukuo and Soviet Union. Japan reacted quickly and mounted a counterattack with its 1st Infantry Division. The 49th Infantry regiment led by Colonel Mihara Kanae inflicted substancial losses, including the destruction of a Type 1124 BKA gunboat  by combination of machinegun and 37mm AT gunfire. Soviet forces were forced to withdraw and on June 29th, Japanese ambassador Shigemistu Mamoru met foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov who accepted that the island would remain Manchurian. Apparently, the Soviets were more concerned with events unfolding in Northern China and Europe, as well as internal strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33650;Yellow River Flood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33650;The 1938 Yellow River Flood was a flood created by the Nationalist Government in Central China in an attempt to slow down the Japanese advance in China. Dykes on the Yellow river were opened near Huayuankou on early June 1938 and floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of farmland. Casualties were heavy with 400,000 to 500,000 dead and 3 million refugees. Strategic value of the flood has been questioned as it failed to stop the Japanese advance towards Wuhan. It also produced a long term psychological effect on the Chinese population: large parts of the people held the KMT responsible for the losses and switched alleigiance to the Japanese or the Communist Chinese...\n\n§RNote for player: due to the flooding, the infrastructure in the area southeast of Zhengzhou will be heavily damaged and much harder to attack due to the mud and destruction for 4 months, the coal mines present there will also be operating at a greatly reduced rate.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
