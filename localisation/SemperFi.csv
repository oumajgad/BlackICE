EVTNAME600;Victorious Battle of the Bzura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600;We have won the Battle of the Bzura!\n\nThe Battle of the Bzura took place from 9 to 19 September 1939 and was fought between Polish and German forces. The battle, which was one of the last major military actions ever to have been conducted on horseback, took place to the west of Warszawa, near the Bzura River. A Polish breakout attack gained initial success but eventually faltered after a concentrated German counterattack. After many long and hard battles, the Germans outflanked the Polish forces and took all of west Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME601;Victorious Battle of Kobryn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC601;We have won the Battle of Kobryn!\n\nThe Battle of Kobryn was fought between September 14 and September 18,1939, between the German XIX Panzer Corps of General Heinz Guderian and the improvised Polish 'Kobryn' Infantry Division of Colonel Adam Epler. The battle of Kobryn came to an end when general Franciszek Kleeberg, due to the information about the Soviet Invasion of Poland pouring in from the frontline and reports about Red Army forces, decided to send orders to all units of his GO 'Polesie' to immediately disengage and withdraw to the south towards the Pinsk Marshes. 60th Infantry Division left Kobryn and marched to the area of Dywin. General Kleeberg also decided to shift the headquarters of his GO 'Polesie' from Pinsk to Lubieszów.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME602;Victorious Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC602;We have won the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski!\n\nThe Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski took place from 17 September to 26 September 1939 near the town of Tomaszów Lubelski. It was the largest tank battle of the campaign. It resulted in the destruction of the Polish forces, which included one of the largest Polish armored units of that time, the Warszawa Armoured Motorized Brigade. Twice during the battle, Polish units attempted to break through the German positions towards the south. The first attempt ended with the capitulation of the Army Lublin on 20 September. The so-called Northern Front made the next attempt. Only the cavalry group under general Wladyslaw Anders was successful. Most of the remaining Polish forces failed to break through and capitulated around 26 September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME603;Victorious Battle of Kock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC603;We have won the Battle of Kock!\n\nThe Battle of Kock was the final battle in the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II. It took place between 2–5 October 1939, near the town of Kock, in Poland. The Polish Polesie Independent Operational Group, led by General Franciszek Kleeberg, fought the German 14th Motorised Corps, led by General Gustav von Wiedesheim. The German 14th Motorised Corps was made up of the 29th and 13th Motorised Infantry Divisions and some independent units. One of the last attacks was by the 29th Motorised Division on the 'Podlaska' Cavalry Brigade positions and the rear of the 'Brzoza' Division. This made the Polish formations withdraw to the south of Kryzywda. The Polesie Independent Group surrendered on 6 October at 1000. In his last order General Kleeberg wrote that the reason for his decision to capitulate was that they were surrounded and ammunition and food were depleted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME604;Victorious Battle of Stalingrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC604;We have won the Battle of Stalingrad!\n\nNazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad. The battle took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as one of the turning points of the war. The German offensive to capture Stalingrad proceeded rapidly in the late summer of 1942, supported by Luftwaffe bombing which reduced much of the city to rubble. But the Wehrmacht was unable to dislodge the last Soviet defenders, who clung tenaciously to the west bank of the Volga River as the weather turned rainy and cold. In November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack on the exposed flanks of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. The weakly held German flanks collapsed and the German 6th Army was cut off and surrounded inside Stalingrad. By early February 1943, German resistance in Stalingrad had ceased, and the surrounded 6th Army had been destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME605;Victorious Battle of Bialystok–Minsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC605;We have won the Battle of Bialystok–Minsk!\n\nThe Battle of Bialystok–Minsk was a German strategic operation conducted by Army Group Centre during the opening stage of Operation Barbarossa lasting from 22 to 29 June 1941. Its goal was encirclement of the Red Army forces around Minsk. Five days after the invasion on 27 June, the pincers of Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army and Hoth's 3rd Panzer Army closed east of Minsk. The Panzer Armies had advanced 321 km into the Soviet Union and almost a third of the distance to Moscow. On 28 June, the 9th and 4th German Armies linked up east of Bialystok, splitting the encircled Soviet forces into two pockets: a smaller Bialystok pocket containing the Soviet 10th Army and a larger Navahrudak pocket containing the 3rd and 13th Armies. On 29 June Minsk, the capital of Belarus, fell to the Wehrmacht. A second Red Army counter-attack by the 20th Mechanized Corps and 4th Airborne Corps failed to breach the encirclement as well, and by 30 June the pocket was completely closed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME606;Victorious Battle of Raseiniai;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC606;We have won the Battle of Raseiniai!\n\nThe Battle of Raseiniai took place from 23 june to 27 June 1941. The tank battle was fought between elements of the 4th Panzer Army and two Soviet Mechanized Corps in Lithuania, 75 km northwest of Kaunas, as the commander of the Northwestern Front attempted to contain and destroy German troops that had crossed the Neman River. The result of the battle was the almost complete destruction of Soviet armoured forces of the Northwestern Front, clearing the way for the continued German offensive towards the crossings of the Daugava River. This was one of the major battles during the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa known in Soviet history as the Border Defensive Battles as part of the larger Baltic Strategic Defensive Operation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME607;Victorious Battle of Dubna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC607;We have won the Battle of Dubna!\n\nThe Battle of Dubna was a tank battle fought between Panzer Group 1's III and XLVIII Army Corps and five Soviet mechanized corps in Soviet-occupied Poland between 26 and 30 June 1941 known in Soviet historiography as the Ukrainian Border Defensive Battles. Although the Red Army formations inflicted heavy losses on the German forces, they were outmanoeuvred and suffered large losses in tanks. This was one of the most intense armoured engagements in the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and remained the largest tank battle of World War II until the Battle of Kursk two years later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME608;Victorious Battle of Kursk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC608;We have won the Battle of Kursk!\n\nThe Battle of Kursk refers to German and Soviet operations on the Eastern Front of World War II in the vicinity of the city of Kursk in July and August 1943. It remains both the largest series of armoured clashes, including the Battle of Prokhorovka and the costliest single day of aerial warfare. It was the last strategic offensive the Germans were able to mount in the east. The resulting decisive Soviet victory gave the Red Army the strategic initiative for the rest of the war.\n\n'Although often thought of as a tank battle, Kursk as a whole arguably demonstrated the triumph of artillery, infantry and engineers over armour. The Soviet plan was to soak up the German assault in a colossal web of defensive positions and only then launch their armoured counter-attack. It was also an important air battle, in which the balance shifted in favour of the Soviets.'\n– John Keegan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME609;Victorious Battle of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC609;We have won the Battle of Smolensk!\n\nThe Battle of Smolensk was a successful encirclement operation by Army Group Centre's 2nd Panzer Army led by Heinz Guderian and the 3rd Panzer Army led by Hermann Hoth of parts of four Soviet Fronts. The Soviet formations were the Western Front commanded by Timoshenko, the Soviet Reserve Front commanded by Zhukov, the Soviet Central Front commanded by Kuznetsov, and the Soviet Bryansk Front commanded by Yeremenko. Ultimately the Soviet 16th, 19th and the 20th Armies were encircled just to the south of Smolensk but large parts of the 19th Army managed to escape the pocket. As a result of many Soviet soldiers escaping the net, Hitler abandoned the encirclement operation as the premier means of defeating the Soviet Union and concentrated on inflicting severe economic damage instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME610;Victorious Battle of Uman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC610;We have won the Battle of Uman!\n\nThe Battle of Uman took place during July 15 – August 8, 1941. It was a German encirclement of the 6th and 12th Soviet armies south of the city of Uman during the initial offensive operations of Army Group South. The battle was part of Operation Barbarossa on the Eastern Front. The battle took place during the Kiev defensive operation by elements of the Red Army's Southwestern Front defending the Southern Bug bridges and the strategic rail road between Odessa and Smolensk, and the offensives by elements of the German 1st Panzer Group in Western Ukraine during its advance from southern Poland to the Crimea. Both Soviet armies had to be disbanded and escaping troops were incorporated into other units. This was among the largest Axis encirclements that were executed against the Red Army in the First period of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME611;Victorious Battle of Moskva;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC611;We have won the Battle of Moskva!\n\nThe Battle of Moskva took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated Hitler's strategy that considered Moskva, capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the largest Soviet city, to be the primary military and political objective for Axis forces in their invasion of the Soviet Union. Prior to Operation Barbarossa, about 40 well-equipped Soviet divisions were stationed in Siberia to keep an eye on Japan. When Stalin realised that Japan wouldn’t attack, these divisions were moved westward and used against the Germans. A desperate Hitler forbade retreat, but the Red Army still pressed back the attacker and one month later, the Wehrmacht had been pressed back up to 250 km. The chance of capturing Moscow was gone. For the Russians this was a very important victory, especially from a morale point of view - the Wehrmacht was not unbeatable after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME612;Victorious Battle of Murmansk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC612;We have won the battle of Murmansk!\n\nOperation Silver Fox was a joint German–Finnish military operation plan during World War II, though it was mainly carried out by the Germans. Its main goal was the capture of the key Soviet port at Murmansk through attacks from Finnish and Norwegian territory. The operation was unsuccessful and Murmansk continued to operate throughout the war and around a quarter of all Lend-Lease materiel was received through this port and the port of Arkhangelsk. The supplies coming through this port helped the Soviets quickly recover from the disasters of 1941. While the rest of the Soviet lines had collapsed in 1941, the forces of Roman Panin's Northern Front had held, causing casualties of up to 15% on the German attackers. The war in the north dragged on until May 1945. In September 1944 the Finns sued for peace and the Lapland War began. In October 1944 the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation, and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME613;Victorious Battle of Brest-Litovsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC613;We have won the Battle of Brest-Litovsk!\n\nThe Battle of Brest-Litovsk took place between 14 and 17 September 1939, near the town of Brest-Litovsk. The Polish forces consisted of a small, improvised force which defended the city of Brest and its ancient fortress. The fortress occupied a pivotal position on the Polish lines and its defence could prevent German forces from crossing the Polesia area into Lesser Poland and Galicia to the south. After three days of heavy fighting, the Polish General Plisowski ordered part of his forces to retreat and regroup on the other side of the river and southwards. The evacuation was completed by the early morning of 17 September when the last unit crossing the bridge blew it up to hinder the Germans. An hour later elements of the German 76th infantry regiment entered the fortress - almost unopposed. The German forces managed to take the fortress and then handed it over to the Red Army. The battle of Brest-Litovsk was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME614;Victorious Battle of Mlawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC614;We have won the Battle of Mlawa!\n\nThe Battle of Mlawa took place from September 1 to September 3, 1939. At noon on September 1, the 1st Army Corps under General Walter Petzel attacked the Polish line of defence. The German engineers managed to cut through Polish antitank barriers on September 3. The Germans used the local civilians as human shields, which allowed them to capture several bunkers on the left flank of the Polish forces, but they were unable to push forwards. On the right flank the attacks were more successful and in the late evening elements of the German Wodrig Corps finally broke through the lines of the 79th Infantry Regiment to the rear of the Poles. General Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski ordered a retreat, finally abandoning the fortified positions. Although the positions were abandoned, the German forces had suffered substantial losses and it was not until September 13 that they finally managed to reach the Modlin Fortress, located less than 100 kilometres to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME615;Victorious Battle of Warszawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC615;We have won the Battle of Warszawa!\n\nThe Battle of Warszawa was fought between the Polish Warszawa Army, garrisoned and entrenched in the capital of Poland, and the German Army. From the very first hours of World War II, Warszawa, the capital of Poland, was a target of an unrestricted aerial bombardment campaign by the German Luftwaffe. Land fighting started on September 8, when the first German armored units reached the Wola area and southwestern suburbs of the city. Despite German radio broadcasts claiming to have captured Warszawa, the attack was stopped and soon afterwards Warszawa was under siege. The siege lasted until September 28, when the Polish garrison under General Walerian Czuma capitulated. The following day approximately 100,000 Polish soldiers left the city and were taken POW. On October 1 the Wehrmacht entered Warszawa, which started a period of German occupation that lasted until the Warszawa Uprising and later until January 17, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME616;Victorious Battle of Den Haag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC616;We have won the Battle of Den Haag!\n\nThe Battle for Den Haag took place on May 10, 1940 as part of the Battle of the Netherlands between the Royal Netherlands Army and German paratroopers. German paratroopers dropped in and around Den Haag with orders to capture Dutch airfields and the city. After taking the city, the plan was to force Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to surrender and to thus defeat the Dutch within a single day. Although the German troops managed to capture the three airfields, Ypenburg, Ockenburg and Valkenburg, they failed in their primary objective of taking the city of Den Haag and forcing the Dutch to surrender. Accordingly, the Dutch Army launched a counter-attack several hours later. By the end of May 10 Dutch forces had retaken the captured airfields, though this tactical victory would be short lived as German successes elsewhere insured the total defeat of the Dutch armed forces just four days after the Germans crossed the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME617;Victorious Rotterdam Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC617;We have won the Rotterdam Blitz!\n\nRotterdam was bombed by the German Air Force on 14 May 1940, during the German invasion of the Netherlands. The objective was to support the German troops fighting in the city, break Dutch resistance, and force the Dutch to surrender. Germany first attacked the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Three days later, on the morning of 13 May 1940, the situation in Rotterdam was a stalemate. Dutch garrison forces held the north bank of the Nieuwe Maas river and prevented the Germans from crossing. The Germans sent in the Luftwaffe and a total of 90 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 54 dropped a total of 1,150 x 50 kg and 158 x 250 kg bombs. Nearly 1,000 people were killed and 85,000 made homeless. Around 2.6 square kilometres of the city were almost levelled. Schmidt, the commander of the German XXXIX Corps, sent a conciliatory message to the Dutch commander in chief General Winkelman, who surrendered shortly afterwards, at Rijsoord, a village southeast of Rotterdam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME618;Victorious Battle for Caen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC618;We have won the Battle for Caen!\n\nThe Battle for Caen took place from June to August 1944 and was a battle between Allied and German forces during the Battle of Normandy. On 18 July, Allied bombers and fighters attacked five villages on the eastern end of Caen in order to facilitate Operation Goodwood. On the right flank of the operation, the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division advanced through the southern part of Caen, finally liberating the city that day. The Germans began a counterattack after midday on 18 July that lasted until 20 July. Operation Goodwood was an immediate tactical failure for the Second Army. However, the operation proved to be a strategic victory at the same time. The operation captured strategically important new ground and tied down four German corps, which included important armoured divisions, at the moment when the Americans were about to launch Operation Cobra. The battle for Caen was over, as the whole of the city was now in British and Canadian hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME619;Victorious Battle of Carentan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC619;We have won the Battle of Carentan!\n\nThe Battle of Carentan took place between June 10 and 14, 1944. The defending German force attempted to hold the city of Carentan long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgements, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-Périers that would cut off the Cotentin Peninsula. The attacking 101st Airborne Division, landed by parachute on June 6 as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy, was ordered to seize Carentan. In the ensuing battle, the 101st forced passage across the causeway into Carentan on June 10 and June 11. A lack of ammunition forced the German forces to withdraw on June 12. The 17th SS PzG Division counter-attacked the 101st Airborne on June 13. Initially successful, its attack was thrown back by Combat Command A of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME620;Victorious Battle of Cherbourg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC620;We have won the Battle of Cherbourg!\n\nThe Battle of Cherbourg was part of the Battle of Normandy. It was fought immediately after the successful Allied landings on June 6, 1944. American troops isolated and then captured the fortified port in a hard-fought campaign of three weeks. The Corps commander, Major General J. Lawton Collins, launched a general assault on June 22. Resistance was stiff at first, but the Americans slowly cleared the Germans from their bunkers and concrete pillboxes. On June 26, the 79th Division captured Fort du Roule, which dominated the city and its defences. The harbor fortifications and the Arsenal surrendered a few days later, after a token resistance. Some German troops cut off outside the defences held out until July 1. The Germans had sustained a major defeat, as a result of a rapid Allied build-up on their western flank and Hitler's rigid orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME621;Victorious Battle of the Dodecanese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC621;We have won the Battle of the Dodecanese!\n\nThe Dodecanese Campaign was an attempt by Allied forces, mostly British, to capture the Italian-held Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea following the surrender of Italy in September 1943, and use them as bases against the German-controlled Balkans. The Allied effort failed, with the whole of the Dodecanese falling to the Germans within two months, and the Allies suffering heavy losses in men and ships. The operations in the Dodecanese, lasting from 8 September to 22 November 1943, resulted in one of the last German victories in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME622;Victorious Battle of Groningen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC622;We have won the Battle of Groningen!\n\nThe Battle of Groningen took place from April 13 to April 16 1945, in the city of Groningen, between a mixture of German soldiers, Dutch and Belgian SS troops and the entire 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. German soldiers in the city were determined to keep enemy forces from German soil while their Dutch SS colleagues had reason to fear for their lives if forced to surrender. The fight in the central market square, Grote markt, was the fiercest part of the battle. There were several German machine guns in the buildings north of the square. The buildings had to be destroyed by tanks. The German commander surrendered on 16 April once it was clear further resistance was useless. Over 5,200 Germans surrendered and the remaining Germans fled northeast, and the 2nd Division again met them in battles such as the Battle of Gruppenbuhren near Delmenhorst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME623;Victorious Battle of San Marino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC623;We have won the Battle of San Marino!\n\nThe Battle of San Marino took place from 17 to 20 September 1944. German forces occupied the neutral Republic of San Marino and were attacked by Allied forces. A strong Allied force aimed to pass through Rimini, east of San Marino, and break out onto the plains north of the city. In response to the Allied movements, the Germans sent a small force into San Marino to guard their lines of communication. After a few days, the main thrust of the offensive was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division, which held two hills just across the Sanmarinese border. After heavy fighting to gain control of the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME624;Victorious Battle of Maastricht;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC624;We have won the Battle of Maastricht!\n\nThe Battle of Maastricht took place May 10, 1940. The Dutch forces defended several important locations around Maastricht such as the sluice complex to the north at Borgharen and several bridges and outer defences of the city. The German forces tried to move into the city and take over the bridges leading over the Maas River. The Dutch however managed to destroy all of the bridges and then the only task that remained was to hold off the Germans as long as they could. German losses in men and vehicles were high. However, the situation for the light Dutch infantry became critical as more and more German armoured vehicles were committed. Many defenders were killed or wounded by the German fire. Headquarters was contacted and the Dutch resistance at Maastricht was ordered to cease. Lieutenant-Colonel Govers went to the Wilhelminabrug under the banner of truce. Soon contact was established. A few hours later, all Dutch troops in Maastricht and surroundings capitulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME625;Victorious Battle of Arnhem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC625;We have won the Battle of Arnhem!\n\nThe Battle of Arnhem took place from 17 to 26 September 1944. After sweeping through France and Belgium in the summer of 1944, the Allies were poised to enter the Netherlands. The Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September. Paratroopers were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance. The British 1st Airborne Division landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Lower Rhine but no reinforcements managed to get to them. The small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed after four days and the rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket. After nine days of fighting, the shattered remains of the airborne forces were withdrawn in Operation Berlin. With no secure bridges the Allies were unable to cross the Rhine and the frontline stabilized south of Arnhem. The 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three quarters of its strength and did not see combat again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME626;Victorious Battle of Metz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC626;We have won the Battle of Metz!\n\nThe Battle of Metz was a land battle fought between Allied and German forces. It took place at the city of Metz following the Normandy landings. The attack on the city by the United States Third Army faced heavy resistance from the defending German forces, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides. The battle lasted for several weeks and U.S. forces captured the heavily fortified city of Metz before the end of November 1944. The battle ended in victory for the allies following the surrender of the remaining German forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME627;Victorious Battle of Monte Castello;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC627;We have won the Battle of Castello!\n\nThe Battle of Monte Castello was fought in Italy from 25 November 1944 to 22 February 1945 and involved the Brazilian Expeditionary Force and the German Army. On November 24 the Brazilians launched a three-day attack that was a compete failure, costing them 34 dead and 153 wounded. On the 29th, the Brazilians again attacked, this time with three battalions, together with support from artillery and tanks, again unsuccessfully. The Allies then pounded the German positions with artillery fire and air attacks for six days. On 12 December, the Brazilians launched a surprise attack, but the US artillery compromised the attack, which soon bogged down. In February, the newly arrived US 10th Mountain Division, supported by the Brazilian artillery and the Brazilian Expeditionary Force's 1st Fighter squadron, captured the outlying German defences on Monte Castello. On 21 February the Brazilians again attacked, this time successfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME628;Victorious Battle of Rovaniemi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC628;We have won the Battle of Rovaniemi!\n\nThe Battle of Rovaniemi was an event during the 1944 Lapland War. The actual fighting between the Finnish Armoured Division and the troops of the German Twentieth Mountain Army took place to the south of the town of Rovaniemi. When the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union started in 1941, the Finnish government had allowed German troops from the German 20th Mountain Army in Norway to be stationed in Lapland to help defend the long border. When the Finns signed a separate peace with the Soviet Union, relations soured between them and the Germans. The Germans had some 200,000 troops in Finland and they were still at war with the Russians. The operation to level Rovaniemi started on October 10th 1944. The mostly wooden town burned for 6 days, with only 13 buildings left standing. There were no civilian casualties as the Finns had already evacuated the town in September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC629;We have won the Battle of Lille!\n\nThe Battle of Lille was fought during the Battle of France. It took place from 28 May 1940 through 31 May 1940 in the surroundings of the city of Lille. It involved approximately 40,000 French of the French First Army who fought against seven German divisions, including three armoured divisions. As a consequence of the continued French resistance, a number of Allied formations managed to escape to Dunkirk. During the battle the French counterattacked, even capturing the German General, Kühne, commander of the German 251st Infantry Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME630;Victorious Battle of Ulm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC630;We have won the Battle of Ulm!\n\nThe city of Ulm was heavily bombed during World War II. The heaviest air raid was on 17 December 1944, which killed or injured hundreds and left 25,000 people homeless. But the Ulm Münster still towered above the ruins, as it was left intact by Allied bombers who utilized it as a navigational landmark. This was the British Royal Air Force Bomber Command's first and only raid on Ulm. Two large truck factories, Magirus-Deutz and Kässbohrer were the primary targets. There were several other important industries and some Wehrmacht barracks and depots. A total of 1,449 tons of bombs were dropped during the 25-minute raid, starting in the city center and then creeping back to the west, across the industrial and railway areas and out into the country. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 establishments destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME631;Victorious Battle of Aachen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC631;We have won the Battle of Aachen!\n\nThe Battle of Aachen took place from 2 to 21 October 1944. By September 1944, the Wehrmacht had been pushed into Germany proper, after being defeated in France by the Western Allies. During the month of September the first fighting sprung up around Aachen and the city's commander offered to surrender it to the advancing Americans. However, the SS discovered his letter of surrender during a raid in Aachen while the civilians were evacuating. Adolf Hitler ordered the commander's immediate arrest and replaced him and his division with Gerhard Wilck's 246th Volksgrenadier Division. The United States' First Army would have to take the city by force. The 30th Infantry Division's offensive began on 2 October and was immediately bogged down by the German defenses. Despite fierce German resistance, German General Wilck surrendered Aachen to American troops on 21 October, ending the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME632;Victorious Battle of Monte Cassino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC632;We have won the Battle of Monte Cassino!\n\nThe Battle of Monte Cassino was a costly series of four battles during World War II, fought by the Allies with the intention of breaking through the Winter Line and seizing Rome. In the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido, Liri and Garigliano valleys and certain surrounding peaks and ridges, together known as the Gustav Line. The Germans had not occupied the historic hilltop abbey of Monte Cassino. On 15 February, the monastery was destroyed by 1,400 tons of bombs dropped by American bombers. Two days after the bombing, German paratroopers took up positions in the ruins. The destruction caused by the bombing and the resulting jagged wasteland of rubble gave troops improved protection from air and artillery attack, making it a more viable defensive position. From 17 January to 18 May, the Gustav defences were unsuccessfully assaulted four times by Allied troops with heavy casualties, until the Germans gave up the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME633;Victorious Battle of Nancy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC633;We have won the Battle of Nancy!\n\nThe Battle of Nancy in September 1944 was a ten-day battle on the Western Front in which the U.S. Third Army defeated German forces defending the approaches to Nancy and crossings over the Moselle River to the north and south of the city. The battle resulted in U.S. forces fighting their way across the Moselle and liberating Nancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME634;Victorious Battle of Bastogne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC634;We have won the Battle of Bastogne!\n\nThe siege of Bastogne was an engagement between American and German forces at the Belgian town of Bastogne, as part of the larger Battle of the Bulge. The goal of the German offensive was the harbor at Antwerp. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the Ardennes mountain range converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. The siege lasted from December 20 to December 27 when the besieged American forces were relieved by elements of General Patton's Third Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME635;Victorious Battle of Debrecen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC635;We have won the Battle of Debrecen!\n\nThe Battle of Debrecen on the Eastern Front, called the Debrecen Offensive Operation by the Red Army, took place between 6 October - 28 October 1944 and was conducted by the 2nd Ukrainian Front. It was opposed by Army Group South Ukraine's General Maximilian Fretter-Pico's Sixth Army and allied Hungarian VII Army Corps units which were forced to retreat some 160 kilometers, while opposing Marshal Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front which had Debrecen in Hungary as its strategic objective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME636;Victorious First Battle of El Alamein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC636;We have won the First Battle of El Alamein!\n\nThe First Battle of El Alamein 1–27 July 1942 was a battle of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War, fought between Axis forces commanded by Erwin Rommel, and Allied forces commanded by Claude Auchinleck. The battle halted the second advance by the Axis forces into Egypt, El Alamein being only 66 miles from Alexandria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME637;Victorious Second Battle of El Alamein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC637;We have won the Second Battle of El Alamein!\n\nThe Second Battle of El Alamein marked a major turning point in the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. The battle lasted from 23 October to 5 November 1942. The First Battle of El Alamein had stalled the Axis advance. Thereafter, Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took command of the British Eighth Army from General Claude Auchinleck in August 1942. The Allied victory turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended Axis hopes of occupying Egypt, taking control of the Suez Canal, and gaining access to the Middle Eastern oil fields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME638;Victorious Battle of Malaya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC638;We have won the Battle of Malaya!\n\nThe Battle of Malaya was a campaign fought by Allied and Japanese forces in Malaya from December 8, 1941 to January 31, 1942. The campaign was dominated by land battles between British Commonwealth army units and the Imperial Japanese Army. For the British, Indian, Australian and Malayan forces defending the colony, the campaign was a disaster. The battle is notable for the Japanese use of bicycle infantry, which allowed troops to carry more equipment and swiftly move through thick jungle terrain. Royal Engineers, equipped with demolition charges, destroyed over a hundred bridges during the retreat, which did little to delay the Japanese. By the time the Japanese had captured Singapore, they had suffered 9,600 casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME639;Victorious Battle of Luzon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC639;We have won the Battle of Luzon!\n\nThe Battle of Luzon was a land battle fought by the Allied forces of the United States, its colony the Philippines, and Mexico against forces of the Empire of Japan. The assault on Luzon was launched on 9 January 1945. The Japanese forces reported more than 70 Allied warships entering the Lingayen Gulf. On 11 February, the 11th Airborne Division captured the last Japanese outer defences around Manila, thus encircling the whole city. US and Filipino forces carried out clearing operations in the city in the following weeks. Casualties totalled 1,010 Americans and 12,000 Japanese. Battles continued throughout the island of Luzon in the following weeks, with more US troops having landed on the island. The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations on Luzon by March. Casualties were stunningly high for both sides. Japanese losses were 205,535 dead, with 9,050 taken prisoners. Allied losses were far lower, with 8,310 dead and 29,560 wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME640;Victorious Battle of Guadalcanal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC640;We have won the Battle of Guadalcanal!\n\nThe Battle of Guadalcanal was fought between August 7, 1942 and February 9, 1943. On August 7, Allied forces initiated landings and captured the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the US, Australia, and New Zealand. Surprised by the Allied offensive, the Japanese made several attempts between August and November 1942 to retake Henderson Field from the U.S. Marines. Three major land battles, five large naval battles and continual, almost daily aerial battles culminated in the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November 1942, in which the last Japanese attempt to land enough troops to retake Henderson Field was defeated. In December 1942, the Japanese abandoned further efforts to retake Guadalcanal and evacuated their remaining forces by February 7, 1943 in the face of an offensive by the U.S. Army's XIV Corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME641;Victorious Battle of Saipan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC641;We have won the Battle of Saipan!\n\nThe Battle of Saipan was a battle of the Pacific campaign, fought on the island of Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 15 June 1944 to 9 July 1944. The invasion fleet embarking the expeditionary forces left Pearl Harbor on June 5 1944, the same day Operation Overlord in Europe was launched. The United States 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, defeated the 43rd Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME642;Victorious Battle of Bryanskaja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC642;We have won the Battle of Bryanskaja!\n\nThe Battle of Bryansk, which was fought between 2–21 October 1941, was a nineteen-day fighting retreat conducted in the Bryansk Oblast. This battle served as the catalyst for the invention of the AK47. Mikhail Kalashnikov was a senior sergeant and tank commander serving on the T-34s of the 24th Tank Regiment, 12th Tank Division of the 8th Mechanised Corps stationed in Stryi before retreating after the Battle of Brody, with the regiment soon to become a part of the 159th Tank Brigade. He was wounded during the battle, but made it to a hospital on foot, where he received medical attention. While recovering from his injuries, Kalashnikov started experiencing flashbacks of the raid and 'became obsessed with creating a submachine gun that would drive the Germans from his homeland.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME643;Victorious First Battle of Kharkov;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC643;We have won the First Battle of Kharkov!\n\nThe First Battle of Kharkov was the 1941 tactical Wehrmacht battle for the city of Kharkov during the final phase of Operation Barbarossa by the German 6th Army of Army Group South on October 20, 1941. The Soviet 38th Army was ordered to defend the city while its factories were dismantled for relocation farther east. By October 21, all of the factory equipment had been loaded on to rail trains. On this day the Germans closed to within 11 km of the railway yards. The German 6th Army executed a northern envelopment of the city while the 17th Army did the same from the south of the Soviet defensive positions on October 24. Although the city was taken by German troops on the same day, most of the rail transport was evacuated by the Soviet authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME644;Victorious Second Battle of Kharkov;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC644;We have won the Second Battle of Kharkov!\n\nThe Second Battle of Kharkov took place from May 12 to May 28, 1942 and was an Axis counteroffensive against the Red Army Izium bridgehead offensive. After a successful winter counteroffensive that had driven German troops away from Moscow, but also depleted the Red Army's reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise. On May 12 1942, Soviet forces launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counteroffensive. After initial promising signs, the offensive was stopped by German counterattacks. Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin himself, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly-trained forces, led to a successful German pincer attack cutting off advancing Soviet troops from the rest of the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME645;Victorious Third Battle of Kharkov;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC645;We have won the Third Battle of Kharkov!\n\nThe Third Battle of Kharkov was a series of offensive operations on the Eastern Front undertaken by the German Army Group South against the Red Army, around the city of Kharkov between 19 February and 15 March 1943. Known to the Germans as the Donets Campaign, and to the Soviets as the Donbas and Kharkov operations, the German counterstrike led to the destruction of approximately 52 Soviet divisions and the recapture of the cities of Kharkov and Belgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME646;Victorious Battle of Odessa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC646;We have won the Battle of Odessa!\n\nThe Siege of Odessa was part of the Soviet-German War in 1941. Romanian forces and elements of the German Army’s 11th Army primarily conducted the siege. Due to the heavy resistance of the 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army, which was formed from the Coastal Group of the 9th Army, and the Black Sea Fleet forces in Odessa, it took the Romanian army 73 days of siege and four attempts to take the city, during which it suffered 93,000 casualties. On 14 October 1941, most of the remaining forces of the Red Army were evacuated. Organised resistance was left behind to terrorise German, Romanian, and Italian forces during the occupation of the city. It was the only major Soviet city to be captured by a German ally without significant German assistance. In April 1944, the Red Army liberated Odessa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME647;Victorious Battle of Bautzen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC647;We have won the Battle of Bautzen!\n\nThe Battle of Bautzen took place during April 1945 and was fought on the extreme southern flank of the Spremberg–Torgau Offensive. It saw days of pitched street fighting between forces of the 2nd Polish Army, the Red Army's 52nd Army and remnants of the German 4th Panzer and 17th Armies, and was the last successful German armoured counteroffensive of the Second World War. The battle was fought in the town of Bautzen and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the line Bautzen - Niesky. Combat began on April 21 1945, and continued up to April 26. There were still isolated engagements up to April 30. The battle appears to have been part of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front push toward Berlin, part of the larger Soviet Berlin Offensive. In particular, the Polish Second Army under Karol Swierczewski suffered high losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME648;Victorious Battle of Orsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648;We have won the Battle of Orsha!\n\nThe Battle of Orsha was a series of battles, fought by the Red Army and the Wehrmacht, during the winter of 1943/1944. It belongs to the so-called 'forgotten battles' due to low regard in Soviet post-war history. The battle is remarkable for its high casualty count despite the fact the Red Army achieved none of their objectives. Orsha was a main traffic junction with the south-north road from Leningrad to Kiev and the east-west road from Moscow to Minsk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME649;Victorious Battle of Belgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC649;We have won the Battle of Belgorod!\n\nThe Belgorod-Bogodukhov Offensive Operation, fought between 23 July and 14 August 1943, was a combat operation executed as part of Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev by the Red Army against the Wehrmacht forces. It was one of the operations that followed the Battle of Kursk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME650;Victorious Battle of Halbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC650;We have won the Battle of Halbe!\n\nThe Battle of Halbe took place from April 24 to May 1, 1945 and was a battle in which the Red Army destroyed the German Ninth Army. The Ninth Army, trapped in a large pocket in the Spree Forest region south-east of Berlin, attempted to break out of the pocket westwards through the village of Halbe and the pine forests south of Berlin to link up with the German Twelfth Army with the intention of heading west and surrendering to the Western Allies. To do this the Ninth Army had to fight its way through three lines of Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front, while at the same time units of the 1st Belorussian Front attacked the German rearguard from the northeast. After very heavy fighting about 25,000 German soldiers - one third of those trapped in the pocket - managed to reach the comparative safety of the Twelfth Army's front lines. The rest were either killed or captured by the Soviets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME651;Victorious Battle of Narva;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC651;We have won the Battle of Narva!\n\nThe Battle of Narva took place from 2 February to 10 August 1944 and was a military campaign between the German army detachment 'Narwa' and the Soviet Leningrad Front. The campaign took place in the northern section of the Eastern Front. The Soviet Kingisepp–Gdov and Narva Offensives were part of the Winter Spring Campaign of 1944. The Soviet Narva Offensive captured the city and forced the German forces to retreat to their prepared Tannenberg Defence Line in the hills of Sinimäed 16 kilometres from Narva. In the ensuing fierce Battle of Tannenberg Line, the German army group held the line. Stalin's main strategic goal - a quick occupation of Estonia as a base for air- and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia - was not achieved. As a result of the lengthy German defence, the Soviet war effort in the Baltic Sea region was hampered for seven and a half months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME652;Victorious Battle of Hanko;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC652;We have won the Battle of Hanko!\n\nThe Battle of Hanko was a battle during the Finnish Offensive of the Continuation War. As part of the Moscow Peace Treaty, Hanko had been leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base. A volunteer Swedish battalion participated in the siege. The last Soviet soldiers left the peninsula in December 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME653;Victorious Battle of Ilomantsi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC653;We have won the Battle of Ilomantsi!\n\nThe Battle of Ilomantsi took place from July 26 to August 13, 1944, between Finland and the Soviet Union. The battle ended with a decisive Finnish victory, as the last major Soviet attack against Finland was stopped here. Two Soviet divisions had advanced towards Ilomantsi, and on July 21, 1944, the Red Army units were able to reach the Finnish-Soviet border of 1940. Finnish forces shattered the Soviet divisions, and those who escaped death were driven back east. This was the ninth major Finnish defence victory in only a few weeks' time. Moscow could now only decide that the Finns had plenty of fight left in them, and that they would never accept an unconditional surrender. The Finns had achieved victory, and the remnants of the two Red Army divisions had barely escaped destruction, by breaking out from the encirclements. After the battle, Stavka brought its offensive to a halt and gave up the demand of Finland’s unconditional surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME654;Victorious Battle of Ancona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC654;We have won the Battle of Ancona!\n\nThe Battle of Ancona was a battle involving forces from Poland serving as part of the British Army and German forces that took place between 16 June and 18 July 1944 during the Italian campaign. The battle was the result of an Allied plan to capture the city of Ancona in Italy in order to gain possession of a seaport closer to the fighting so that they could shorten their lines of communication. The Polish 2nd Corps was tasked with the capture of the city on 16 June 1944, accomplishing the task a month later on 18 July 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME655;Victorious Battle of Bologna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC655;We have won the Battle of Bologna!\n\nThe Battle of Bologna was fought from 9 to 21 April 1945. The offensive on Bologna started with a major air and artillery bombardment of the German positions, followed by an attack the same evening. The American and British units engaged the German flanks, while the Polish units broke through to the city. On 10 April, Polish forces pushed the Germans away from the Senio River. Between 12–14 April Polish forces fought the Germans at the Santerno River, and captured Imola. From 15–16 April, the Polish units fought at the Sillaro River and the Medicina Canal. On 21 April the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Brigade of the Polish 3rd Carpathian Infantry Division entered the city, where only isolated German units were still fighting. The Poles secured the city and displayed Polish flags from the town hall and the Torre Asinelli tower. The local Italian population welcomed the Poles as their liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME656;Victorious Battle of Ortona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC656;We have won the Battle of Ortona!\n\nThe Battle of Ortona took place from December 20 to December 28, 1943, and was a small yet extremely fierce battle fought between a battalion of German Fallschirmjäger from the 1st Parachute Division and assaulting Canadian forces. The initial Canadian attack on the town was made on December 20 by the Canadian 2nd Brigade's Loyal Edmonton Regiment with elements of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada under command. Elements of the division's 3rd Infantry Brigade launched a northerly attack to the west of the town in an attempt to outflank and cut off the town's rear communications but made slow progress because of the difficult terrain and the skilful and determined German defence. After six days of intense combat the 2nd Brigade's third battalion joined the battle together with tanks from the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade's Three Rivers Regiment. On December 28 the depleted German troops finally withdrew from the town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME657;Victorious Battle of Rimini;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC657;We have won the Battle of Rimini!\n\nThe Battle of Rimini is a name used to describe Operation Olive, the main Allied offensive on the Gothic Line in August and September 1944 during the Italian Campaign. It has been described as the biggest battle of materials ever fought in Italy. Over 1,200,000 men participated in the battle, which was a victory for the Allies although they did not achieve the hoped-for decisive breakthrough. The battle took the form of a pincer manoeuvre, carried out by the British 8th Army and U.S. 5th Army against the German Tenth and Fourteenth Armies. Rimini, a city that had been hit previously by air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces. According to the CO of the British 8th Army Sir Oliver Leese, 'The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to El Alamein, Mareth and the Gustav Line'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME658;Victorious Battle of Breslau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC658;We have won the Battle of Breslau!\n\nThe Siege of Breslau took place from 13 February to 6 May 1945 and was a three month long Soviet siege of the city of Breslau in Lower Silesia, Germany. The German garrison's surrender on 6 May was followed the next day by the surrender of all German forces. The city was besieged as a result of the Lower Silesian Offensive during 13 February, by the 6th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front and completed the encirclement of Breslau the next day. The 1st Ukrainian Front forces besieged the city with the 22nd and 74th Rifle Corps, and the 77th Fortified Region, as well as other smaller units.

EVTDESC659;We have won the Battle of Borodino!\n\nThe Battle at Borodino Field was a part of the Battle of Moskva, on the Eastern Front of World War II. At noon on 13 October 1941, German Junkers and Messerschmitt aircraft appeared over the Borodino Field. On 16 October, severe fighting broke out in the center of Borodino Field. The Germans managed to take the field, the Spaso-Borodinsky Monastery was burnt and the Borodino Museum suffered damage. The 82nd Soviet Rifle Division freed Borodino Field during the counter-offensive. A monument was later erected in the field with the inscription in bas-relief: 'Here, on the lines of the sacred Borodino Field in October, 1941 the heroic units of the 5th Army have been fighting to the bitter end, rebutting the furious onslaught of German fascist usurpers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME660;Victorious Battle of Budapest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC660;We have won the Battle of Budapest!\n\nThe Siege of Budapest was a siege of the Hungarian capital city of Budapest, fought towards the end of World War II in Europe, during the Soviet Budapest Offensive. The siege started when the Red Army and the Romanian Army first encircled Budapest, defended by Hungarian and German troops, on 29 December 1944. The siege ended when the city was unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945. The Soviet forces besieging the city were part of Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front. Arrayed against the Soviets was a collection of German Army, Waffen-SS, and Hungarian Army forces. The Siege of Budapest was one of the bloodiest sieges of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME661;Victorious Battle of Kerch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC661;We have won the Battle of Kerch!\n\nThe Battle of the Kerch Peninsula took place from May 8, 1942 to May 18, 1942 and was an offensive by German and Romanian armies against the Soviet Crimean Front forces defending the Kerch Peninsula, in the eastern part of the Crimea. The Red Army lost over 170,000 men killed or taken prisoner, and three armies with twenty-one divisions. The operation was one of the battles immediately preceding the German summer offensive and its successful conclusion made it possible for the Axis to launch a successful assault on Sevastopol in the following months. Some groups of Soviet survivors refused to surrender and fought on for many months, hiding in the catacombs of the quarries. Many of these soldiers were occupying the caves along with many civilians, who had fled the city of Kerch. Many of them died underground, including those who died of numerous poison gas attacks during counterattacks by the German Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME662;Victorious Battle of Kolberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC662;We have won the Battle of Kolberg!\n\nThe Battle of Kolberg was the taking of the city of Kolberg in Pomerania by the Soviet Army and its Polish allies from Nazi German forces during the East Pomeranian Offensive. Between March 4 and March 18, 1945, there was major urban fighting between Soviet and Polish forces and the German army for control over the city. The Germans succeeded in evacuating much of their military personnel and refugees from the city via sea before the Poles took it on March 18.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME663;Victorious Battle of Sevastopol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC663;We have won the Battle of Sevastopol!\n\nThe Siege of Sevastopol took place from 30 October 1941 to 4 July 1942 between German forces and those of the Red Army, the Black Sea Fleet and elements of the Red Air Force for control over the main Soviet Black Sea Fleet naval base.

EVTNAME664;Victorious Battle for Velikie Luki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC664;We have won the Battle for Velikie Luki!\n\nThe Velikiye Luki offensive operation was executed by the forces of the Red Army's Kalinin Front against the Wehrmacht’s 3rd Panzer Army during the Winter Campaign of 1942-1943 with the objective of liberating the Russian city of Velikie Luki as part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive Operation. It is particularly notable as an example of the failure of German operational combat in relieving an encirclement, similar to those employed at the Battle of Stalingrad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME665;Victorious Battle of Voronez;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC665;We have won the Battle of Voronez!\n\nThe Battle of Voronez took place from December 1941 to 6 July 1942. The city was defended by the troops of the 40th Army as part of the Valuiki-Rossosh Defensive Operation. The German assault was conducted by elements of the 4th Panzer Army's forces of Army Group South, commanded by General Hermann Hoth. Hoth was under strict instructions not to get bogged down in street-to-street fighting. The armoured units of the 4th Panzer Army partly captured Voronez on 6 July by occupying the western river-bank suburbs. However German troops were subjected to a Red Army counter-attack. The 4th Panzer Army was to be followed by the Sixth Army, and when Voronez was occupied the former was to wheel south-eastward and move down the right bank of the Don towards Stalingrad as part of Operation Blau. It took two days for infantry divisions from Army Group South to reach Voronez to hold the line and free the Panzer troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME666;Victorious Battle of Calais;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC666;We have won the Battle of Calais!\n\nThe Battle of Calais took place from 22 May to 26 May 1940. When the German offensive was launched in May 1940, Calais was subjected to increasingly heavy bombing, which caused disruption to military movements. On 20 May, the Germans seized Abbeville on the River Somme, capturing the last bridges over the river before the sea, and effectively isolating the BEF in Flanders and Picardy, cut off from its logistic bases. The War Office in Britain hastily despatched troops to the Channel ports, in case they were required either to re-supply the BEF or evacuate it. On the morning of 26 May, Calais Nord and the Citadel were pounded by artillery, and by 200 German bombers. About mid-afternoon, the Germans finally crossed the bridges over the canal and advanced into Calais Nord. On the other side of the harbour, they captured the Gare Maritime. The citadel was surrounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME667;Victorious Battle of Gazala;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC667;We have won the Battle of Gazala!\n\nThe Battle of Gazala was an important battle of the Western Desert Campaign, fought around the port of Tobruk in Libya from May 26 to June 21, 1942. The combatants on the Axis side were the Panzer Army Afrika, consisting of German and Italian units and commanded by the 'Desert Fox' Colonel-General Erwin Rommel. The Allied forces were the Eighth Army, commanded by Major General Neil Ritchie under the close supervision of the Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Sir Claude Auchinleck. The battle ended in a resounding victory for the Axis. However, devoid of effective armoured forces in subsequent battles, Rommel was unable to pursue and decisively defeat the Eighth Army in Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME668;Victorious Battle of Kassel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC668;We have won the Battle of Kassel!\n\nThe Battle of Kassel was a four-day struggle between the U.S. Army and the German Army in April 1945 for Kassel, a medium-sized city northeast of Frankfurt am Main. The battle resulted as the U.S. Third Army pushed northeast from the region of Frankfurt and Mainz. The battle opened on April 1, 1945 and ended with an American victory three days later. Opposing the Third Army's 80th Infantry Division were an infantry replacement battalion, some heavy tanks, and anti-aircraft guns. Although the Germans gave battle at Kassel, their army was on the brink of collapse as the Western Allies and the Red Army made deep inroads into Germany. The defence of Kassel did not materially impede the Allied advance, and, one month after the battle ended, Germany was forced to capitulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME669;Victorious Battle of Tornio;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC669;We have won the Battle of Tornio!\n\nThe Battle of Tornio took place from October 1 to October 8, 1944 and was the first major engagement between Nazi Germany and Finland in the Lapland War. The Finnish Infantry Regiment 11 landed unopposed at Röyttä harbour and took the town of Tornio the same day. The German troops in town were surrounded in a few pockets until they surrendered. Further landings in Tornio the next day came under attack from Stuka bombers of the Luftwaffe, but were completed successfully despite casualties of 60 men. German counter attacks were repulsed with the aid of a battery of field artillery that was part of the second landing and fire support from Finnish gunboats. Due to lack of roads, the supplies to the troops around Kemi would have to be routed through Rovaniemi. This forced the Germans to withdraw their units from Kemi. By October 8 the whole Kemi-Tornio area had been cleared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME670;Victorious Battle of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC670;We have won the Battle of Malta!\n\nThe Siege of Malta was a military campaign in the Mediterranean Theatre and took place from 1940 to 1942. The fight for the control of the strategically important island of Malta pitted the air forces and navies of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. From Malta, British air and sea forces could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to the Axis forces in North Africa. Malta was one of the most intensively bombed areas during the war. The German Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica flew a total of 3,000 bombing raids over a period of two years. Axis plans were made for Operation Herkules, an amphibious invasion of the island supported by airborne forces, but these were never carried out. In the end, Allied convoys were able to supply and reinforce Malta, though at great cost. This played a major role in the eventual Allied victory in North Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME671;Victorious Battle of Grudziadz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC671;We have won the Battle of Grudziadz!\n\nThe Battle of Grudziadz took place from 1 September to 4 September 1939. It was a military engagement between German and Polish forces during the Invasion of Poland in 1939. The German XXI Corps assaulted the city on 1 September. The German 21st and 218th Infantry Divisions pushed back the Polish lines to the small river Ossa, east of Grudziadz. On 3 September elements of the German 45th Infantry Regiment managed to break into the town itself. The Germans held out there until the evening, but had to retreat when the Polish pressure increased. At the same time the Polish commander Boltuc received news that the Polish divisions on the western bank of the Vistula were facing defeat and the German forces had already crossed the Vistula in the south. This forced him to pull back his units in order to avoid being encircled soon. The Polish defenders destroyed the bridges over the Vistula and retreated to the southeast. The Germans occupied the city on 4 September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME672;Victorious Battle of Jaroslaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC672;We have won the Battle of Jaroslaw!\n\nThe Battle of Jaroslaw took place between September 10 and September 11, 1939, in the city of Jaroslaw on the San River. During the battle the Polish forces of General Stanislaw Maczek successfully held the river crossings in the town for two days against the Nazi-German Wehrmacht, which was enough time for the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade to cross the river and retreat further eastwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME673;Victorious Battle of Kaluszyn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC673;We have won the Battle of Kaluszyn!\n\nThe Battle of Kaluszyn took place from September 11 to September 12, 1939. German forces of the 11th Infantry Division, who managed to take the town and surround the Polish forces, overran them. The Polish aim was to retake the town and break through the German encirclement before panzer reinforcements arrived and enemy resistance stiffened. The Polish forces managed to break through the positions of the enemy 44th Infantry Regiment. An order for the 4th Squadron of the Polish 11th Uhlans Regiment to advance towards the town itself was mistakenly understood as an order for a cavalry charge and the squadron rushed towards the enemy positions. Thanks to the accidental charge the Poles broke through to the town. The Polish infantry followed into the breach in the German defences and by the early morning the town was liberated and the German division sent in retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME674;Victorious Battle of Lódz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC674;We have won the Battle of Lódz!\n\nThe Battle of Lódz took place from September 6 to 8, 1939. By September 6, two Wehrmacht army groups had linked up at Lódz. While Lódz was under the control of the Wehrmacht, the 4th Panzer Division continued to advance east towards Warsaw. By September 8, the German advance stalled at the gates of Warsaw. The Polish Army launched a counterattack between Lódz and Warsaw in hopes off cutting off the German army's supply lines and recapturing the city of Lódz. After three days of bitter fighting, Germany defeated the desperate Polish counterattack. The city of Lódz was occupied by Germany on September 8, 1939. Recognizing the failed counterattack, all Polish forces were ordered to fall back, regroup in Eastern Poland for a last stand, and wait for aid from Great Britain and France, which would never come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME675;Victorious Battle of Lwów;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC675;We have won the Battle of Lwów!\n\nThe Battle of Lwów was a battle for the control over the Polish city of Lwów between the Polish Army, the invading Wehrmacht and the Red Army. Soviet armoured units were pushed back after a short fight. The Soviet forces completed the encirclement of the city and joined up with the German army besieging Lwów from the west. The same day the German commander sent his envoy and demanded that the city be surrendered to Germany. When the Polish envoy replied that he had no intention of signing such a document, he was informed that the general assault was ordered on September 21 and that the city would most surely be taken. However, on September 20 the Germans left their positions to the north and south of the city, and were replaced with Soviet soldiers. On September 22, 1939, the act of surrender was signed in the suburb of Winniki.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME676;Victorious Battle of Radom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC676;We have won the Battle of Radom!\n\nThe Battle of Radom was part of the Invasion of Poland during the Second World War. It lasted from 8 September 1939 to 9 September 1939. Polish troops of the Prusy Army, under Colonel Muzyka, defended the city of Ilza and the road from Sandomierz to Radom. The Polish infantry were eventually defeated by German armoured troops and made their last stand in an ancient castle on a hill near Ilza.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME677;Victorious Battle of Hong Kong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC677;We have won the Battle of Hong Kong!\n\nThe Battle of Hong Kong took place during the Pacific Campaign. It began on 8 December 1941 and ended on Christmas Day with Hong Kong, then a Crown colony, surrendering to the Empire of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME678;Victorious Battle of Ambon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC678;We have won the Battle of Ambon!\n\nThe Battle of Ambon took place from 30 January to 3 February 1942. Dutch and Australian forces resisted a Japanese invasion. From 6 January onwards, Japanese aircraft attacked Ambon. Allied aircraft made some sorties against the approaching Japanese fleet, with little success. The naval aviation base at Halong was soon rendered unusable by Japanese air raids, and was abandoned by the Dutch and US navies in mid-January. The first land attack on Laha occurred on the afternoon of 31 January. Japanese forces were also approaching the town of Ambon from the southwest and on 31 January, the Japanese captured the town. By the morning of 3 February, the Australians around Eri were struggling to cope with increasing air and naval attacks, wounded Australians, the influx of Dutch personnel, diminishing supplies and widespread fatigue. A Japanese flag had been seen flying on the other side of the bay, at Laha. The Allied position at Kudamati was surrendered separately at midday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME679;Victorious Battle of Balikpapan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC679;We have won the Battle of Balikpapan!\n\nThe Battle of Balikpapan took place on 1 July 1945. The Australian 7th Division, composed of the 18th, 21st and 25th Infantry Brigades made an amphibious landing on the island of Borneo. Heavy bombing and shelling by Australian and US air and naval forces had preceded the landing. The Japanese were totally outnumbered and outgunned. Major operations had ceased by July 21. The 7th Division's casualties were significantly lighter than in previous campaigns. Japan surrendered while the Australians were combing the jungle for stragglers. Following the surrender the three brigades were committed to occupation duties until around February 1946. The 21st Brigade was detached to Makassar in the Celebes Islands to accept the surrender of the Japanese forces, release POWs and maintain civil order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME680;Victorious Battle of Beirut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC680;We have won the Battle of Beirut!\n\nThe Battle of Beirut took place on 12 July 1941 and marked the end of hostilities in the Syria-Lebanon campaign. On 8 July, even before the fall of Damour, the Vichy French commander, General Henri Dentz, had sought an armistice. At one minute past midnight on 12 July a ceasefire came into effect. For all intents and purposes, this ended the campaign and an armistice was signed on 14 July at the 'Sidney Smith Barracks' on the outskirts of the city of Acre. The triumphant entry of the Australian 7th Division into Beirut successfully established the Allied occupation of Lebanon. Beirut later became an important Allied base for Mediterranean naval operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME681;Victorious Battle of Kranj;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC681;We have won the Battle of Kranj!\n\nThe Battle of Kranj took place from 9 February to 15 February 1942. The Japanese Army assaulted the northwestern front of the British colony of Singapore with the primary objective to secure a second beachhead after their successful assault at Sarimbun Beach on 8 February, in order to breach the Jurong-Kranj defence line as part of their southward thrust towards the heart of Singapore City. Defending the shoreline between the Kranj River and the Johor-Singapore Causeway was the Australian 27th Brigade. On 10 February the Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses while moving up the Kranj River, which caused them to panic and nearly abort the operation. However, a series of miscommunications and withdrawals by Allied forces in the ensuing battles allowed the Japanese to swiftly gain strategic footholds, which eventually led to the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME682;Victorious Battle of Wau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC682;We have won the Battle of Wau!\n\nThe Battle of Wau, 29–31 January 1943, was a battle in the New Guinea campaign. Forces of the Empire of Japan sailed from Rabaul and crossed the Solomon Sea and, despite Allied air attacks, successfully reached Lae, where they disembarked. Japanese troops then advanced overland on Wau, an Australian base that potentially threatened the Japanese positions at Salamaua and Lae. A race developed between the Japanese moving overland, hampered by the terrain, and the Australians, moving by air, hampered by the weather. By the time the Japanese reached the Wau area after a trek over the mountains, the Australian defenders had been greatly reinforced by air. In the battle that followed, despite achieving tactical surprise by approaching from an unexpected direction, the Japanese attackers were unable to capture Wau.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME683;Victorious Battle of Singapore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC683;We have won the Battle of Singapore!\n\nThe Battle of Singapore was fought in the Southeast Asian theatre when the Empire of Japan invaded the Allied stronghold of Singapore. Singapore was the major British military base in South East Asia and nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the East'. The fighting in Singapore lasted from 8 December 1941 to 15 February 1942. It resulted in the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, and the largest surrender of British-led military personnel in history. About 80,000 British, Australian and Indian troops became prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the Malayan campaign. Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the ignominious fall of Singapore to the Japanese the 'worst disaster' and 'largest capitulation' in British history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME684;Victorious Battle of Tarakan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC684;We have won the Battle of Tarakan!\n\nThe Battle of Tarakan was the first stage in the Borneo campaign of 1945. It began with an amphibious landing by Australian forces on 1 May, code-named Operation Oboe One. While the battle ended with success for the Allied forces over the Japanese defenders, this victory is generally regarded as having not justified its costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME685;Victorious Battle in Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC685;We have won the Battle in Berlin!\n\nThe Battle in Berlin dealt with the ever tightening ring around the German capital. The outcome of the Battle in Berlin was decided during the initial phases of the Battle of Berlin that took place outside the city. As the Soviets invested Berlin and the German forces placed to stop them were destroyed or forced back, the city's fate was sealed. Nevertheless, there was much heavy fighting within the city of Berlin as the Red Army fought its way, street by street, through to the centre of the city. On 23 April 1945, the first Soviet ground forces started to penetrate the outer suburbs of Berlin. By 27 April, Berlin was completely cut off from the outside world. The battle in the city continued until 2 May 1945. On that date, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, General Helmuth Weidling, surrendered to the commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, Lieutenant-General Vasily Chuikov. Chuikov's forces were part of Marshal Georgiy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME686;Victorious Battle of Pegu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC686;We have won the Battle of Pegu!\n\nThe Battle of Pegu took place from 3 March to 7 March 1942. Japanese forces closed in on the British Indian Army, which was deployed near Pegu. The 'B' Squadron of the 7th Hussars arrived in the village of Payagyi to find the Japanese already there. A confused battle ensued. Then the order came for the British to move to Hlegu. Hlegu was also in Japanese hands as the British approached. The Japanese had erected a roadblock and they defended it with molotov cocktails. In the end, they were forced to retreat in the face of heavy fire from the tanks. General Alexander had realised that Rangoon was doomed, and his new plan involved a withdrawal to Prome, some 200 miles to the north. The objective, to convince the Japanese that Rangoon would be defended, had been achieved. The British Indian Army moved on to Taukkyan that evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME687;Victorious Battle of Tampere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC687;We have won the Battle of Tampere!\n\nThe Battle of Tampere of the Finnish Civil War was fought in Finland in 1918 between Red and White forces. The White forces besieged and captured the main city of the Red Guards, Tampere, taking 10,000 Red prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME688;Victorious Battle of Wilno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC688;We have won the Battle of Wilno!\n\nThe Battle of Wilno was one of the major battles during the Soviet invasion of Poland that accompanied the larger German invasion. During the days of 18-19 September, the Soviet forces approached and took over the major city of Wilno. The Polish forces in the area were relatively weak and the Polish commanders, unsure whether to actively oppose the Soviets, did not utilise the full defensive capabilities of the town and nearby fortified areas, although the outcome of the battle could not have been any different given the overwhelming Soviet numerical superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME689;Victorious Battle of Palmyra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC689;We have won the Battle of Palmyra!\n\nThe Battle of Palmyra was part of the Allied invasion of Syria during the Syria-Lebanon campaign. The Habforce set off on June 21 and surrounded Palmyra. On June 28 they captured the French fort of Seba' Biyar, the small garrison surrendering without a shot fired, and the next day they occupied Sukhna. On the morning of July 1 Sukhna was attacked by the Vichy 2nd Light Desert Company. The Arab Legion occupiers had been reinforced by a squadron from 4th Cavalry Brigade's Household Cavalry Regiment and after a sharp battle, the French retreated and ended up trapped in a box valley before surrendering. Whilst hardly the largest battle of the war, its effect was to cause the 3rd Light Desert Company to lose heart and they surrendered Palmyra on the night of 2 July.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME690;Victorious Battle of Leningrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC690;We have won the Battle of Leningrad!\n\nThe Siege of Leningrad took place from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944. It was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and the most costly in terms of casualties. It caused the greatest destruction and the largest loss of life ever known in a modern city. Most of the palaces of the Tsars and other historic landmarks located outside the city's defensive perimeter were looted and then destroyed. A number of factories, schools, hospitals and other civil infrastructure were destroyed by air raids and long-range artillery bombardment. The siege resulted in the deaths of up to 1,500,000 soldiers and civilians and the evacuation of 1,400,000. Civilians in the city suffered from extreme starvation. In January-February of 1942 about 7000-10,000 citizens died every day, most of them from hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME691;Victorious Battle of Iwo Jima;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC691;We have won the Battle of Iwo Jima!\n\nThe Battle of Iwo Jima took place from February 19 to March 26, 1945. The United States fought for and captured Iwo Jima from Japan. The Japanese positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 km of underground tunnels. The Americans were covered by extensive naval and air support, capable of putting an enormous amount of firepower onto the Japanese positions. The U.S. invasion was charged with the mission of capturing the two airfields on Iwo Jima. Despite heavy fighting and casualties on both sides, Japanese defeat was assured from the start. The Americans possessed an overwhelming superiority in arms and numbers - this, coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, ensured that there was no plausible scenario in which the United States could have lost the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME692;Victorious Battle of Dakar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC692;We have won the Battle of Dakar!\n\nThe Battle of Dakar was an unsuccessful attempt in September 1940 by the Allies to capture the strategic port of Dakar in French West Africa. The Allies decided to send a naval force of an aircraft carrier, two battleships, five cruisers, and ten destroyers to Dakar. The Allied fleet attacked the coastal defences, and the Vichy forces defended them. Overall, the Battle of Dakar did not go well for the Allies. The Vichy forces did not back down. During most of this conflict, bombers of the Vichy French Air Force based in North Africa bombed the British base at Gibraltar. On September 24 about 50 aircraft dropped 150 bombs while on September 25 about 100 aircraft dropped 300 bombs on the harbor and dockyards. Most of the bombs missed. Some damage but few casualties were caused. Finally, the Allies withdrew, leaving Dakar and French West Africa in Vichy hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME693;Victorious Battle of Nanchang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC693;We have won the Battle of Nanchang!\n\nThe Battle of Nanchang was the first major conflict to occur following the Chinese defeat at the Battle of Wuhan. Nanchang was a railway center, the major supply line between the 3rd and 9th Military Regions, and site of the airbase threatening Japanese shipping in the Yangtze River. By March 27, Nanchang had fallen after being surrounded and put under siege by Japanese forces. During a period lasting until the end of April some Japanese forces were moved to support operations in other areas. This weakening of available Japanese manpower had consequences. On April 21, a surprise attack by the forces of the 3rd and 9th Military Regions allowed for a breakthrough by the 32nd Army Group that allowed a Chinese spearhead to reach the outer area of Nanchang in 5 days. However, under heavy attack from Japanese Aviation and facing a Japanese garrison reinforced by components of the Navy they were unable to lay an effective siege and retreated on May 9.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME694;Victorious First Battle of Guam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC694;We have won the First Battle of Guam!\n\nThe First Battle of Guam took place from December 8 to December 10, 1941 between Japanese and American forces. On December 8, Japanese aircraft from Saipan attacked Guam. On December 10, the 5th Company landed on Dungcas Beach on Agana Bay north of Agana, attacked and quickly captured the Insular Force Guard in Agana. It then advanced on Piti, moving toward Sumay and the Marine Barracks. The South Seas Detachment began landing on the north flank of Tumon Bay on the upper northwest coast and moved towards Agana. The principal engagement took place on Agana's Plaza de España when a few Marines and Insular Force Guardsmen fought with the 5th Company. After token resistance, the Marines and Governor McMillin surrendered. No further fighting took place, but a few skirmishes took place all over the island before news of the surrender spread and the rest of the island forces surrendered as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME695;Victorious Second Battle of Guam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC695;We have won the Second Battle of Guam!\n\nThe Second Battle of Guam took place from July 21 to August 8, 1944 and was the American capture of the Japanese-held island of Guam during the Pacific Campaign. On July 21 the Americans landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam. Japanese counter-attacks were made throughout the first few days of the battle, mostly at night, using infiltration tactics. Several times they penetrated the American defences and were driven back with heavy loss of men and equipment. The counterattacks around the American beachheads had exhausted the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a handful of tanks left. After an engagement at Mount Barrigada from August 2 to August 4, the Japanese line collapsed and the rest of the battle was a pursuit to the north. As in other battles of the Pacific War, the Japanese refused to surrender, and almost all were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME696;Victorious Battle of Rabaul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC696;We have won the Battle of Rabaul!\n\nThe Battle of Rabaul took place in January and February 1942. In January 1942, Rabaul came under attack by large numbers of Japanese carrier-based aircraft. On 21 January, eight Wirraways attacked a formation of 109 Japanese aircraft. Three RAAF planes were shot down, two crash-landed, and another was damaged. As a result of the intense air attacks, Australian coastal artillery was destroyed and Australian infantry were withdrawn from Rabaul itself. Rabaul became the biggest Japanese base in New Guinea. The Australians tried to restrict its development soon after its capture by a bombing counter attack in March. In December 1943, during the Battle of Cape Gloucester, U.S. Marines landed in western New Britain and consequent Allied operations on New Britain gradually restricted the Japanese force to Rabaul. However, a large number of Japanese personnel remained in Rabaul until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME697;Victorious First Battle of Changsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC697;We have won the First Battle of Changsha!\n\nThe First Battle of Changsha took place from September 17, 1939 to October 6, 1939 and was the first attempt by Japan to take the city of Changsha, China. The Japanese launched the attacks on September 17, when their forces in northern Jiangxi attacked westward toward Henan. However, the Japanese stretched too far out westward and were counter-attacked by Chinese forces from the south and the north, forcing them to retreat eastward. On September 23 the Japanese drove the Chinese out of the Sinchiang river area. Heavy fighting continued after the 23rd and the Chinese retreated southward to distract the Japanese while supporting battalions arrived in the east and the west for an encirclement maneuver. On September 29 the Japanese reached the outskirts of Changsha. However, they were unable to conquer the city because the Chinese cut off their supply lines. By October 6 the Japanese forces at Changsha were decimated while the remnants retreated northward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME698;Victorious Second Battle of Changsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC698;We have won the Second Battle of Changsha!\n\nThe Second Battle of Changsha took place from September 6 to October 8, 1941 and was Japan's second attempt at taking the city of Changsha. The battle started when a small Chinese guerrilla force clashed with the Japanese 6th Division in the mountains southeast of Yueyang on September 6th. On the 17th, the Japanese crossed the Sinchiang River at four points and made rapid advances, crossing the Milo River on the 19th. The main Chinese force avoided confronting the enemy but marched in a parallel fashion flanking the Japanese trail southward. The Chinese and the Japanese army reached the Laotao River regions for an inevitable battle. On September 27th, several hundred Japanese troops in plain clothes reached the north gate of Changsha but were unable to sabotage the city defences, leading to heavy fighting on the 28th. Unable to overcome the defenders, the Japanese began a general retreat back to the Yueyang region on September 30th.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME699;Victorious Third Battle of Changsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC699;We have won the Third Battle of Changsha!\n\nThe Third Battle of Changsha was the third attempt by the Japanese to invade the Chinese province of Hunan. In June 1944 the Japanese deployed 360,000 troops to invade Changsha. On 27 May, 1944, the Japanese 11th Army launched the 1944 general offensive toward Changsha as scheduled. The Japanese flanked the Chinese troops defending Changsha and cut off their possible retreat routes, and placed some secondary divisions in charge of attacking Changsha. The Chinese attempted to use the previous tactic of avoiding direct contact by marching in parallel fashion to flank the Japanese, but were unable to encircle the enemy like before and had to retreat. This allowed the IJA to rapidly ransack the city of Changsha, breaking the defences of the infantry within the city, as well as neutralizing the Chinese artillery on Yuelu Mountain, and Changsha was quickly lost to the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME700;Disastrous Battle of the Bzura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC700;We have lost the battle of the Bzura!\n\nThe Battle of the Bzura took place from 9 to 19 September 1939 and was fought between Polish and German forces. The battle, which was one of the last major military actions ever to have been conducted on horseback, took place to the west of Warszawa, near the Bzura River. A Polish breakout attack gained initial success but eventually faltered after a concentrated German counterattack. After many long and hard battles, the Germans outflanked the Polish forces and took all of west Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC701;We have lost the battle of Kobryn!\n\nThe Battle of Kobryn was fought between September 14 and September 18,1939, between the German XIX Panzer Corps of General Heinz Guderian and the improvised Polish 'Kobryn' Infantry Division of Colonel Adam Epler. The battle of Kobryn came to an end when general Franciszek Kleeberg, due to the information about the Soviet Invasion of Poland pouring in from the frontline and reports about Red Army forces, decided to send orders to all units of his GO 'Polesie' to immediately disengage and withdraw to the south towards the Pinsk Marshes. 60th Infantry Division left Kobryn and marched to the area of Dywin. General Kleeberg also decided to shift the headquarters of his GO 'Polesie' from Pinsk to Lubieszów.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME702;Disastrous Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC702;We have lost the battle of Tomaszów Lubelski!\n\nThe Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski took place from 17 September to 26 September 1939 near the town of Tomaszów Lubelski. It was the largest tank battle of the campaign. It resulted in the destruction of the Polish forces, which included one of the largest Polish armored units of that time, the Warszawa Armoured Motorized Brigade. Twice during the battle, Polish units attempted to break through the German positions towards the south. The first attempt ended with the capitulation of the Army Lublin on 20 September. The so-called Northern Front made the next attempt. Only the cavalry group under general Wladyslaw Anders was successful. Most of the remaining Polish forces failed to break through and capitulated around 26 September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME703;Disastrous Battle of Kock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC703;We have lost the battle of Kock!\n\nThe Battle of Kock was the final battle in the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II. It took place between 2–5 October 1939, near the town of Kock, in Poland. The Polish Polesie Independent Operational Group, led by General Franciszek Kleeberg, fought the German 14th Motorised Corps, led by General Gustav von Wiedesheim. The German 14th Motorised Corps was made up of the 29th and 13th Motorised Infantry Divisions and some independent units. One of the last attacks was by the 29th Motorised Division on the 'Podlaska' Cavalry Brigade positions and the rear of the 'Brzoza' Division. This made the Polish formations withdraw to the south of Kryzywda. The Polesie Independent Group surrendered on 6 October at 1000. In his last order General Kleeberg wrote that the reason for his decision to capitulate was that they were surrounded and ammunition and food were depleted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME704;Disastrous Battle of Stalingrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC704;We have lost the battle of Stalingrad!\n\nNazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad. The battle took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as one of the turning points of the war. The German offensive to capture Stalingrad proceeded rapidly in the late summer of 1942, supported by Luftwaffe bombing which reduced much of the city to rubble. But the Wehrmacht was unable to dislodge the last Soviet defenders, who clung tenaciously to the west bank of the Volga River as the weather turned rainy and cold. In November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack on the exposed flanks of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. The weakly held German flanks collapsed and the German 6th Army was cut off and surrounded inside Stalingrad. By early February 1943, German resistance in Stalingrad had ceased, and the surrounded 6th Army had been destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME705;Disastrous Battle of Bialystok–Minsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC705;We have lost the battle of Bialystok–Minsk!\n\nThe Battle of Bialystok–Minsk was a German strategic operation conducted by Army Group Centre during the opening stage of Operation Barbarossa lasting from 22 to 29 June 1941. Its goal was encirclement of the Red Army forces around Minsk. Five days after the invasion on 27 June, the pincers of Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army and Hoth's 3rd Panzer Army closed east of Minsk. The Panzer Armies had advanced 321 km into the Soviet Union and almost a third of the distance to Moscow. On 28 June, the 9th and 4th German Armies linked up east of Bialystok, splitting the encircled Soviet forces into two pockets: a smaller Bialystok pocket containing the Soviet 10th Army and a larger Navahrudak pocket containing the 3rd and 13th Armies. On 29 June Minsk, the capital of Belarus, fell to the Wehrmacht. A second Red Army counter-attack by the 20th Mechanized Corps and 4th Airborne Corps failed to breach the encirclement as well, and by 30 June the pocket was completely closed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME706;Disastrous Battle of Raseiniai;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC706;We have lost the battle of Raseiniai!\n\nThe Battle of Raseiniai took place from 23 june to 27 June 1941. The tank battle was fought between elements of the 4th Panzer Army and two Soviet Mechanized Corps in Lithuania, 75 km northwest of Kaunas, as the commander of the Northwestern Front attempted to contain and destroy German troops that had crossed the Neman River. The result of the battle was the almost complete destruction of Soviet armoured forces of the Northwestern Front, clearing the way for the continued German offensive towards the crossings of the Daugava River. This was one of the major battles during the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa known in Soviet history as the Border Defensive Battles as part of the larger Baltic Strategic Defensive Operation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME707;Disastrous Battle of Dubna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC707;We have lost the battle of Dubna!\n\nThe Battle of Dubna was a tank battle fought between Panzer Group 1's III and XLVIII Army Corps and five Soviet mechanized corps in Soviet-occupied Poland between 26 and 30 June 1941 known in Soviet historiography as the Ukrainian Border Defensive Battles. Although the Red Army formations inflicted heavy losses on the German forces, they were outmanoeuvred and suffered large losses in tanks. This was one of the most intense armoured engagements in the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and remained the largest tank battle of World War II until the Battle of Kursk two years later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME708;Disastrous Battle of Kursk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC708;We have lost the battle of Kursk!\n\nThe Battle of Kursk refers to German and Soviet operations on the Eastern Front of World War II in the vicinity of the city of Kursk in July and August 1943. It remains both the largest series of armoured clashes, including the Battle of Prokhorovka and the costliest single day of aerial warfare. It was the last strategic offensive the Germans were able to mount in the east. The resulting decisive Soviet victory gave the Red Army the strategic initiative for the rest of the war.\n\n'Although often thought of as a tank battle, Kursk as a whole arguably demonstrated the triumph of artillery, infantry and engineers over armour. The Soviet plan was to soak up the German assault in a colossal web of defensive positions and only then launch their armoured counter-attack. It was also an important air battle, in which the balance shifted in favour of the Soviets.'\n– John Keegan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME709;Disastrous Battle of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC709;We have lost the battle of Smolensk!\n\nThe Battle of Smolensk was a successful encirclement operation by Army Group Centre's 2nd Panzer Army led by Heinz Guderian and the 3rd Panzer Army led by Hermann Hoth of parts of four Soviet Fronts. The Soviet formations were the Western Front commanded by Timoshenko, the Soviet Reserve Front commanded by Zhukov, the Soviet Central Front commanded by Kuznetsov, and the Soviet Bryansk Front commanded by Yeremenko. Ultimately the Soviet 16th, 19th and the 20th Armies were encircled just to the south of Smolensk but large parts of the 19th Army managed to escape the pocket. As a result of many Soviet soldiers escaping the net, Hitler abandoned the encirclement operation as the premier means of defeating the Soviet Union and concentrated on inflicting severe economic damage instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME710;Disastrous Battle of Uman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC710;We have lost the battle of Uman!\n\nThe Battle of Uman took place during July 15 – August 8, 1941. It was a German encirclement of the 6th and 12th Soviet armies south of the city of Uman during the initial offensive operations of Army Group South. The battle was part of Operation Barbarossa on the Eastern Front. The battle took place during the Kiev defensive operation by elements of the Red Army's Southwestern Front defending the Southern Bug bridges and the strategic rail road between Odessa and Smolensk, and the offensives by elements of the German 1st Panzer Group in Western Ukraine during its advance from southern Poland to the Crimea. Both Soviet armies had to be disbanded and escaping troops were incorporated into other units. This was among the largest Axis encirclements that were executed against the Red Army in the First period of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME711;Disastrous Battle of Moskva;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC711;We have lost the battle of Moskva!\n\nThe Battle of Moskva took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated Hitler's strategy that considered Moskva, capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the largest Soviet city, to be the primary military and political objective for Axis forces in their invasion of the Soviet Union. Prior to Operation Barbarossa, about 40 well-equipped Soviet divisions were stationed in Siberia to keep an eye on Japan. When Stalin realised that Japan wouldn’t attack, these divisions were moved westward and used against the Germans. A desperate Hitler forbade retreat, but the Red Army still pressed back the attacker and one month later, the Wehrmacht had been pressed back up to 250 km. The chance of capturing Moscow was gone. For the Russians this was a very important victory, especially from a morale point of view - the Wehrmacht was not unbeatable after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME712;Disastrous Battle of Murmansk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC712;We have lost the battle of Murmansk!\n\nOperation Silver Fox was a joint German–Finnish military operation plan during World War II, though it was mainly carried out by the Germans. Its main goal was the capture of the key Soviet port at Murmansk through attacks from Finnish and Norwegian territory. The operation was unsuccessful and Murmansk continued to operate throughout the war and around a quarter of all Lend-Lease materiel was received through this port and the port of Arkhangelsk. The supplies coming through this port helped the Soviets quickly recover from the disasters of 1941. While the rest of the Soviet lines had collapsed in 1941, the forces of Roman Panin's Northern Front had held, causing casualties of up to 15% on the German attackers. The war in the north dragged on until May 1945. In September 1944 the Finns sued for peace and the Lapland War began. In October 1944 the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation, and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME713;Disastrous Battle of Brest-Litovsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC713;We have lost the battle of Brest-Litovsk!\n\nThe Battle of Brest-Litovsk took place between 14 and 17 September 1939, near the town of Brest-Litovsk. The Polish forces consisted of a small, improvised force which defended the city of Brest and its ancient fortress. The fortress occupied a pivotal position on the Polish lines and its defence could prevent German forces from crossing the Polesia area into Lesser Poland and Galicia to the south. After three days of heavy fighting, the Polish General Plisowski ordered part of his forces to retreat and regroup on the other side of the river and southwards. The evacuation was completed by the early morning of 17 September when the last unit crossing the bridge blew it up to hinder the Germans. An hour later elements of the German 76th infantry regiment entered the fortress - almost unopposed. The German forces managed to take the fortress and then handed it over to the Red Army. The battle of Brest-Litovsk was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME714;Disastrous Battle of Mlawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC714;We have lost the battle of Mlawa!\n\nThe Battle of Mlawa took place from September 1 to September 3, 1939. At noon on September 1, the 1st Army Corps under General Walter Petzel attacked the Polish line of defence. The German engineers managed to cut through Polish antitank barriers on September 3. The Germans used the local civilians as human shields, which allowed them to capture several bunkers on the left flank of the Polish forces, but they were unable to push forwards. On the right flank the attacks were more successful and in the late evening elements of the German Wodrig Corps finally broke through the lines of the 79th Infantry Regiment to the rear of the Poles. General Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski ordered a retreat, finally abandoning the fortified positions. Although the positions were abandoned, the German forces had suffered substantial losses and it was not until September 13 that they finally managed to reach the Modlin Fortress, located less than 100 kilometres to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME715;Disastrous Battle of Warszawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC715;We have lost the battle of Warszawa!\n\nThe Battle of Warszawa was fought between the Polish Warszawa Army, garrisoned and entrenched in the capital of Poland, and the German Army. From the very first hours of World War II, Warszawa, the capital of Poland, was a target of an unrestricted aerial bombardment campaign by the German Luftwaffe. Land fighting started on September 8, when the first German armored units reached the Wola area and southwestern suburbs of the city. Despite German radio broadcasts claiming to have captured Warszawa, the attack was stopped and soon afterwards Warszawa was under siege. The siege lasted until September 28, when the Polish garrison under General Walerian Czuma capitulated. The following day approximately 100,000 Polish soldiers left the city and were taken POW. On October 1 the Wehrmacht entered Warszawa, which started a period of German occupation that lasted until the Warszawa Uprising and later until January 17, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME716;Disastrous Battle of Den Haag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC716;We have lost the battle of Den Haag!\n\nThe Battle for Den Haag took place on May 10, 1940 as part of the Battle of the Netherlands between the Royal Netherlands Army and German paratroopers. German paratroopers dropped in and around Den Haag with orders to capture Dutch airfields and the city. After taking the city, the plan was to force Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to surrender and to thus defeat the Dutch within a single day. Although the German troops managed to capture the three airfields, Ypenburg, Ockenburg and Valkenburg, they failed in their primary objective of taking the city of Den Haag and forcing the Dutch to surrender. Accordingly, the Dutch Army launched a counter-attack several hours later. By the end of May 10 Dutch forces had retaken the captured airfields, though this tactical victory would be short lived as German successes elsewhere insured the total defeat of the Dutch armed forces just four days after the Germans crossed the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME717;Disastrous Rotterdam Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC717;We have lost the battle of Rotterdam!\n\nRotterdam was bombed by the German Air Force on 14 May 1940, during the German invasion of the Netherlands. The objective was to support the German troops fighting in the city, break Dutch resistance, and force the Dutch to surrender. Germany first attacked the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Three days later, on the morning of 13 May 1940, the situation in Rotterdam was a stalemate. Dutch garrison forces held the north bank of the Nieuwe Maas river and prevented the Germans from crossing. The Germans sent in the Luftwaffe and a total of 90 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 54 dropped a total of 1,150 x 50 kg and 158 x 250 kg bombs. Nearly 1,000 people were killed and 85,000 made homeless. Around 2.6 square kilometres of the city were almost levelled. Schmidt, the commander of the German XXXIX Corps, sent a conciliatory message to the Dutch commander in chief General Winkelman, who surrendered shortly afterwards, at Rijsoord, a village southeast of Rotterdam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME718;Disastrous Battle for Caen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC718;We have lost the battle of Caen!\n\nThe Battle for Caen took place from June to August 1944 and was a battle between Allied and German forces during the Battle of Normandy. On 18 July, Allied bombers and fighters attacked five villages on the eastern end of Caen in order to facilitate Operation Goodwood. On the right flank of the operation, the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division advanced through the southern part of Caen, finally liberating the city that day. The Germans began a counterattack after midday on 18 July that lasted until 20 July. Operation Goodwood was an immediate tactical failure for the Second Army. However, the operation proved to be a strategic victory at the same time. The operation captured strategically important new ground and tied down four German corps, which included important armoured divisions, at the moment when the Americans were about to launch Operation Cobra. The battle for Caen was over, as the whole of the city was now in British and Canadian hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME719;Disastrous Battle of Carentan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC719;We have lost the battle of Carentan!\n\nThe Battle of Carentan took place between June 10 and 14, 1944. The defending German force attempted to hold the city of Carentan long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgements, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-Périers that would cut off the Cotentin Peninsula. The attacking 101st Airborne Division, landed by parachute on June 6 as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy, was ordered to seize Carentan. In the ensuing battle, the 101st forced passage across the causeway into Carentan on June 10 and June 11. A lack of ammunition forced the German forces to withdraw on June 12. The 17th SS PzG Division counter-attacked the 101st Airborne on June 13. Initially successful, its attack was thrown back by Combat Command A of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME720;Disastrous Battle of Cherbourg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC720;We have lost the battle of Cherbourg!\n\nThe Battle of Cherbourg was part of the Battle of Normandy. It was fought immediately after the successful Allied landings on June 6, 1944. American troops isolated and then captured the fortified port in a hard-fought campaign of three weeks. The Corps commander, Major General J. Lawton Collins, launched a general assault on June 22. Resistance was stiff at first, but the Americans slowly cleared the Germans from their bunkers and concrete pillboxes. On June 26, the 79th Division captured Fort du Roule, which dominated the city and its defences. The harbor fortifications and the Arsenal surrendered a few days later, after a token resistance. Some German troops cut off outside the defences held out until July 1. The Germans had sustained a major defeat, as a result of a rapid Allied build-up on their western flank and Hitler's rigid orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME721;Disastrous Battle of Dodecanese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC721;We have lost the battle of Dodecanese!\n\nThe Dodecanese Campaign was an attempt by Allied forces, mostly British, to capture the Italian-held Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea following the surrender of Italy in September 1943, and use them as bases against the German-controlled Balkans. The Allied effort failed, with the whole of the Dodecanese falling to the Germans within two months, and the Allies suffering heavy losses in men and ships. The operations in the Dodecanese, lasting from 8 September to 22 November 1943, resulted in one of the last German victories in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME722;Disastrous Battle of Groningen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC722;We have lost the battle of Groningen!\n\nThe Battle of Groningen took place from April 13 to April 16 1945, in the city of Groningen, between a mixture of German soldiers, Dutch and Belgian SS troops and the entire 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. German soldiers in the city were determined to keep enemy forces from German soil while their Dutch SS colleagues had reason to fear for their lives if forced to surrender. The fight in the central market square, Grote markt, was the fiercest part of the battle. There were several German machine guns in the buildings north of the square. The buildings had to be destroyed by tanks. The German commander surrendered on 16 April once it was clear further resistance was useless. Over 5,200 Germans surrendered and the remaining Germans fled northeast, and the 2nd Division again met them in battles such as the Battle of Gruppenbuhren near Delmenhorst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME723;Disastrous Battle of San Marino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC723;We have lost the Battle of San Marino!\n\nThe Battle of San Marino took place from 17 to 20 September 1944. German forces occupied the neutral Republic of San Marino and were attacked by Allied forces. A strong Allied force aimed to pass through Rimini, east of San Marino, and break out onto the plains north of the city. In response to the Allied movements, the Germans sent a small force into San Marino to guard their lines of communication. After a few days, the main thrust of the offensive was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division, which held two hills just across the Sanmarinese border. After heavy fighting to gain control of the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME724;Disastrous Battle of Maastricht;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC724;We have lost the battle of Maastricht!\n\nThe Battle of Maastricht took place May 10, 1940. The Dutch forces defended several important locations around Maastricht such as the sluice complex to the north at Borgharen and several bridges and outer defences of the city. The German forces tried to move into the city and take over the bridges leading over the Maas River. The Dutch however managed to destroy all of the bridges and then the only task that remained was to hold off the Germans as long as they could. German losses in men and vehicles were high. However, the situation for the light Dutch infantry became critical as more and more German armoured vehicles were committed. Many defenders were killed or wounded by the German fire. Headquarters was contacted and the Dutch resistance at Maastricht was ordered to cease. Lieutenant-Colonel Govers went to the Wilhelminabrug under the banner of truce. Soon contact was established. A few hours later, all Dutch troops in Maastricht and surroundings capitulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME725;Disastrous Battle of Arnhem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC725;We have lost the battle of Arnhem!\n\nThe Battle of Arnhem took place from 17 to 26 September 1944. After sweeping through France and Belgium in the summer of 1944, the Allies were poised to enter the Netherlands. The Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September. Paratroopers were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance. The British 1st Airborne Division landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Lower Rhine but no reinforcements managed to get to them. The small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed after four days and the rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket. After nine days of fighting, the shattered remains of the airborne forces were withdrawn in Operation Berlin. With no secure bridges the Allies were unable to cross the Rhine and the frontline stabilized south of Arnhem. The 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three quarters of its strength and did not see combat again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME726;Disastrous Battle of Metz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC726;We have lost the battle of Metz!\n\nThe Battle of Metz was a land battle fought between Allied and German forces. It took place at the city of Metz following the Normandy landings. The attack on the city by the United States Third Army faced heavy resistance from the defending German forces, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides. The battle lasted for several weeks and U.S. forces captured the heavily fortified city of Metz before the end of November 1944. The battle ended in victory for the allies following the surrender of the remaining German forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME727;Disastrous Battle of Monte Castello;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC727;We have lost the battle of Monte Castello!\n\nThe Battle of Monte Castello was fought in Italy from 25 November 1944 to 22 February 1945 and involved the Brazilian Expeditionary Force and the German Army. On November 24 the Brazilians launched a three-day attack that was a compete failure, costing them 34 dead and 153 wounded. On the 29th, the Brazilians again attacked, this time with three battalions, together with support from artillery and tanks, again unsuccessfully. The Allies then pounded the German positions with artillery fire and air attacks for six days. On 12 December, the Brazilians launched a surprise attack, but the US artillery compromised the attack, which soon bogged down. In February, the newly arrived US 10th Mountain Division, supported by the Brazilian artillery and the Brazilian Expeditionary Force's 1st Fighter squadron, captured the outlying German defences on Monte Castello. On 21 February the Brazilians again attacked, this time successfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME728;Disastrous Battle of Rovaniemi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC728;We have lost the battle of Rovaniemi!\n\nThe Battle of Rovaniemi was an event during the 1944 Lapland War. The actual fighting between the Finnish Armoured Division and the troops of the German Twentieth Mountain Army took place to the south of the town of Rovaniemi. When the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union started in 1941, the Finnish government had allowed German troops from the German 20th Mountain Army in Norway to be stationed in Lapland to help defend the long border. When the Finns signed a separate peace with the Soviet Union, relations soured between them and the Germans. The Germans had some 200,000 troops in Finland and they were still at war with the Russians. The operation to level Rovaniemi started on October 10th 1944. The mostly wooden town burned for 6 days, with only 13 buildings left standing. There were no civilian casualties as the Finns had already evacuated the town in September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME729;Disastrous Battle of Lille;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC729;We have lost the battle of Lille!\n\nThe Battle of Lille was fought during the Battle of France. It took place from 28 May 1940 through 31 May 1940 in the surroundings of the city of Lille. It involved approximately 40,000 French of the French First Army who fought against seven German divisions, including three armoured divisions. As a consequence of the continued French resistance, a number of Allied formations managed to escape to Dunkirk. During the battle the French counterattacked, even capturing the German General, Kühne, commander of the German 251st Infantry Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME730;Disastrous Battle of Ulm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC730;We have lost the battle of Ulm!\n\nThe city of Ulm was heavily bombed during World War II. The heaviest air raid was on 17 December 1944, which killed or injured hundreds and left 25,000 people homeless. But the Ulm Münster still towered above the ruins, as it was left intact by Allied bombers who utilized it as a navigational landmark. This was the British Royal Air Force Bomber Command's first and only raid on Ulm. Two large truck factories, Magirus-Deutz and Kässbohrer were the primary targets. There were several other important industries and some Wehrmacht barracks and depots. A total of 1,449 tons of bombs were dropped during the 25-minute raid, starting in the city center and then creeping back to the west, across the industrial and railway areas and out into the country. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 establishments destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME731;Disastrous Battle of Aachen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC731;We have lost the battle of Aachen!\n\nThe Battle of Aachen took place from 2 to 21 October 1944. By September 1944, the Wehrmacht had been pushed into Germany proper, after being defeated in France by the Western Allies. During the month of September the first fighting sprung up around Aachen and the city's commander offered to surrender it to the advancing Americans. However, the SS discovered his letter of surrender during a raid in Aachen while the civilians were evacuating. Adolf Hitler ordered the commander's immediate arrest and replaced him and his division with Gerhard Wilck's 246th Volksgrenadier Division. The United States' First Army would have to take the city by force. The 30th Infantry Division's offensive began on 2 October and was immediately bogged down by the German defenses. Despite fierce German resistance, German General Wilck surrendered Aachen to American troops on 21 October, ending the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME732;Disastrous Battle of Monte Cassino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732;We have lost the battle of Monte Cassino!\n\nThe Battle of Monte Cassino was a costly series of four battles during World War II, fought by the Allies with the intention of breaking through the Winter Line and seizing Rome. In the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido, Liri and Garigliano valleys and certain surrounding peaks and ridges, together known as the Gustav Line. The Germans had not occupied the historic hilltop abbey of Monte Cassino. On 15 February, the monastery was destroyed by 1,400 tons of bombs dropped by American bombers. Two days after the bombing, German paratroopers took up positions in the ruins. The destruction caused by the bombing and the resulting jagged wasteland of rubble gave troops improved protection from air and artillery attack, making it a more viable defensive position. From 17 January to 18 May, the Gustav defences were unsuccessfully assaulted four times by Allied troops with heavy casualties, until the Germans gave up the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME733;Disastrous Battle of Nancy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC733;We have lost the battle of Nancy!\n\nThe Battle of Nancy in September 1944 was a ten-day battle on the Western Front in which the U.S. Third Army defeated German forces defending the approaches to Nancy and crossings over the Moselle River to the north and south of the city. The battle resulted in U.S. forces fighting their way across the Moselle and liberating Nancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME734;Disastrous Battle of Bastogne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC734;We have lost the battle of Bastogne!\n\nThe siege of Bastogne was an engagement between American and German forces at the Belgian town of Bastogne, as part of the larger Battle of the Bulge. The goal of the German offensive was the harbor at Antwerp. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the Ardennes mountain range converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. The siege lasted from December 20 to December 27 when the besieged American forces were relieved by elements of General Patton's Third Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME735;Disastrous Battle of Debrecen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC735;We have lost the battle of Debrecen!\n\nThe Battle of Debrecen on the Eastern Front, called the Debrecen Offensive Operation by the Red Army, took place between 6 October - 28 October 1944 and was conducted by the 2nd Ukrainian Front. It was opposed by Army Group South Ukraine's General Maximilian Fretter-Pico's Sixth Army and allied Hungarian VII Army Corps units which were forced to retreat some 160 kilometers, while opposing Marshal Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front which had Debrecen in Hungary as its strategic objective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME736;Disastrous First Battle of El Alamein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC736;We have lost the first battle of El Alamein!\n\nThe First Battle of El Alamein 1–27 July 1942 was a battle of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War, fought between Axis forces commanded by Erwin Rommel, and Allied forces commanded by Claude Auchinleck. The battle halted the second advance by the Axis forces into Egypt, El Alamein being only 66 miles from Alexandria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME737;Disastrous Second Battle of El Alamein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC737;We have lost the second battle of El Alamein!\n\nThe Second Battle of El Alamein marked a major turning point in the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. The battle lasted from 23 October to 5 November 1942. The First Battle of El Alamein had stalled the Axis advance. Thereafter, Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took command of the British Eighth Army from General Claude Auchinleck in August 1942. The Allied victory turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended Axis hopes of occupying Egypt, taking control of the Suez Canal, and gaining access to the Middle Eastern oil fields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME738;Disastrous Battle of Malaya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC738;We have lost the battle of Malaya!\n\nThe Battle of Malaya was a campaign fought by Allied and Japanese forces in Malaya from December 8, 1941 to January 31, 1942. The campaign was dominated by land battles between British Commonwealth army units and the Imperial Japanese Army. For the British, Indian, Australian and Malayan forces defending the colony, the campaign was a disaster. The battle is notable for the Japanese use of bicycle infantry, which allowed troops to carry more equipment and swiftly move through thick jungle terrain. Royal Engineers, equipped with demolition charges, destroyed over a hundred bridges during the retreat, which did little to delay the Japanese. By the time the Japanese had captured Singapore, they had suffered 9,600 casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME739;Disastrous Battle of Luzon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC739;We have lost the battle of Luzon!\n\nThe Battle of Luzon was a land battle fought by the Allied forces of the United States, its colony the Philippines, and Mexico against forces of the Empire of Japan. The assault on Luzon was launched on 9 January 1945. The Japanese forces reported more than 70 Allied warships entering the Lingayen Gulf. On 11 February, the 11th Airborne Division captured the last Japanese outer defences around Manila, thus encircling the whole city. US and Filipino forces carried out clearing operations in the city in the following weeks. Casualties totalled 1,010 Americans and 12,000 Japanese. Battles continued throughout the island of Luzon in the following weeks, with more US troops having landed on the island. The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations on Luzon by March. Casualties were stunningly high for both sides. Japanese losses were 205,535 dead, with 9,050 taken prisoners. Allied losses were far lower, with 8,310 dead and 29,560 wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME740;Disastrous Battle of Guadalcanal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC740;We have lost the battle of Guadalcanal!\n\nThe Battle of Guadalcanal was fought between August 7, 1942 and February 9, 1943. On August 7, Allied forces initiated landings and captured the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the US, Australia, and New Zealand. Surprised by the Allied offensive, the Japanese made several attempts between August and November 1942 to retake Henderson Field from the U.S. Marines. Three major land battles, five large naval battles and continual, almost daily aerial battles culminated in the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November 1942, in which the last Japanese attempt to land enough troops to retake Henderson Field was defeated. In December 1942, the Japanese abandoned further efforts to retake Guadalcanal and evacuated their remaining forces by February 7, 1943 in the face of an offensive by the U.S. Army's XIV Corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME741;Disastrous Battle of Saipan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC741;We have lost the battle of Saipan!\n\nThe Battle of Saipan was a battle of the Pacific campaign, fought on the island of Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 15 June 1944 to 9 July 1944. The invasion fleet embarking the expeditionary forces left Pearl Harbor on June 5 1944, the same day Operation Overlord in Europe was launched. The United States 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, defeated the 43rd Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME742;Disastrous Battle of Bryanskaja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC742;We have lost the battle of Bryanskaja!\n\nThe Battle of Bryansk, which was fought between 2–21 October 1941, was a nineteen-day fighting retreat conducted in the Bryansk Oblast. This battle served as the catalyst for the invention of the AK47. Mikhail Kalashnikov was a senior sergeant and tank commander serving on the T-34s of the 24th Tank Regiment, 12th Tank Division of the 8th Mechanised Corps stationed in Stryi before retreating after the Battle of Brody, with the regiment soon to become a part of the 159th Tank Brigade. He was wounded during the battle, but made it to a hospital on foot, where he received medical attention. While recovering from his injuries, Kalashnikov started experiencing flashbacks of the raid and 'became obsessed with creating a submachine gun that would drive the Germans from his homeland.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME743;Disastrous First Battle of Kharkov;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC743;We have lost the first battle of Kharkov!\n\nThe First Battle of Kharkov was the 1941 tactical Wehrmacht battle for the city of Kharkov during the final phase of Operation Barbarossa by the German 6th Army of Army Group South on October 20, 1941. The Soviet 38th Army was ordered to defend the city while its factories were dismantled for relocation farther east. By October 21, all of the factory equipment had been loaded on to rail trains. On this day the Germans closed to within 11 km of the railway yards. The German 6th Army executed a northern envelopment of the city while the 17th Army did the same from the south of the Soviet defensive positions on October 24. Although the city was taken by German troops on the same day, most of the rail transport was evacuated by the Soviet authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME744;Disastrous Second Battle of Kharkov;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC744;We have lost the second battle of Kharkov!\n\nThe Second Battle of Kharkov took place from May 12 to May 28, 1942 and was an Axis counteroffensive against the Red Army Izium bridgehead offensive. After a successful winter counteroffensive that had driven German troops away from Moscow, but also depleted the Red Army's reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise. On May 12 1942, Soviet forces launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counteroffensive. After initial promising signs, the offensive was stopped by German counterattacks. Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin himself, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly-trained forces, led to a successful German pincer attack cutting off advancing Soviet troops from the rest of the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME745;Disastrous Third Battle of Kharkov;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC745;We have lost the third battle of Kharkov!\n\nThe Third Battle of Kharkov was a series of offensive operations on the Eastern Front undertaken by the German Army Group South against the Red Army, around the city of Kharkov between 19 February and 15 March 1943. Known to the Germans as the Donets Campaign, and to the Soviets as the Donbas and Kharkov operations, the German counterstrike led to the destruction of approximately 52 Soviet divisions and the recapture of the cities of Kharkov and Belgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME746;Disastrous Battle of Odessa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC746;We have lost the battle of Odessa!\n\nThe Siege of Odessa was part of the Soviet-German War in 1941. Romanian forces and elements of the German Army’s 11th Army primarily conducted the siege. Due to the heavy resistance of the 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army, which was formed from the Coastal Group of the 9th Army, and the Black Sea Fleet forces in Odessa, it took the Romanian army 73 days of siege and four attempts to take the city, during which it suffered 93,000 casualties. On 14 October 1941, most of the remaining forces of the Red Army were evacuated. Organised resistance was left behind to terrorise German, Romanian, and Italian forces during the occupation of the city. It was the only major Soviet city to be captured by a German ally without significant German assistance. In April 1944, the Red Army liberated Odessa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME747;Disastrous Battle of Bautzen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC747;We have lost the battle of Bautzen!\n\nThe Battle of Bautzen took place during April 1945 and was fought on the extreme southern flank of the Spremberg–Torgau Offensive. It saw days of pitched street fighting between forces of the 2nd Polish Army, the Red Army's 52nd Army and remnants of the German 4th Panzer and 17th Armies, and was the last successful German armoured counteroffensive of the Second World War. The battle was fought in the town of Bautzen and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the line Bautzen - Niesky. Combat began on April 21 1945, and continued up to April 26. There were still isolated engagements up to April 30. The battle appears to have been part of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front push toward Berlin, part of the larger Soviet Berlin Offensive. In particular, the Polish Second Army under Karol Swierczewski suffered high losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME748;Disastrous Battle of Orsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC748;We have lost the battle of Orsha!\n\nThe Battle of Orsha was a series of battles, fought by the Red Army and the Wehrmacht, during the winter of 1943/1944. It belongs to the so-called 'forgotten battles' due to low regard in Soviet post-war history. The battle is remarkable for its high casualty count despite the fact the Red Army achieved none of their objectives. Orsha was a main traffic junction with the south-north road from Leningrad to Kiev and the east-west road from Moscow to Minsk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME749;Disastrous Battle of Belgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC749;We have lost the battle of Belgorod!\n\nThe Belgorod-Bogodukhov Offensive Operation, fought between 23 July and 14 August 1943, was a combat operation executed as part of Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev by the Red Army against the Wehrmacht forces. It was one of the operations that followed the Battle of Kursk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME750;Disastrous Battle of Halbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC750;We have lost the battle of Halbe!\n\nThe Battle of Halbe took place from April 24 to May 1, 1945 and was a battle in which the Red Army destroyed the German Ninth Army. The Ninth Army, trapped in a large pocket in the Spree Forest region south-east of Berlin, attempted to break out of the pocket westwards through the village of Halbe and the pine forests south of Berlin to link up with the German Twelfth Army with the intention of heading west and surrendering to the Western Allies. To do this the Ninth Army had to fight its way through three lines of Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front, while at the same time units of the 1st Belorussian Front attacked the German rearguard from the northeast. After very heavy fighting about 25,000 German soldiers - one third of those trapped in the pocket - managed to reach the comparative safety of the Twelfth Army's front lines. The rest were either killed or captured by the Soviets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME751;Disastrous Battle of Narva;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC751;We have lost the battle of Narva!\n\nThe Battle of Narva took place from 2 February to 10 August 1944 and was a military campaign between the German army detachment 'Narwa' and the Soviet Leningrad Front. The campaign took place in the northern section of the Eastern Front. The Soviet Kingisepp–Gdov and Narva Offensives were part of the Winter Spring Campaign of 1944. The Soviet Narva Offensive captured the city and forced the German forces to retreat to their prepared Tannenberg Defence Line in the hills of Sinimäed 16 kilometres from Narva. In the ensuing fierce Battle of Tannenberg Line, the German army group held the line. Stalin's main strategic goal - a quick occupation of Estonia as a base for air- and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia - was not achieved. As a result of the lengthy German defence, the Soviet war effort in the Baltic Sea region was hampered for seven and a half months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME752;Disastrous Battle of Hanko;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC752;We have lost the battle of Hanko!\n\nThe Battle of Hanko was a battle during the Finnish Offensive of the Continuation War. As part of the Moscow Peace Treaty, Hanko had been leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base. A volunteer Swedish battalion participated in the siege. The last Soviet soldiers left the peninsula in December 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME753;Disastrous Battle of Ilomantsi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC753;We have lost the battle of Ilomantsi!\n\nThe Battle of Ilomantsi took place from July 26 to August 13, 1944, between Finland and the Soviet Union. The battle ended with a decisive Finnish victory, as the last major Soviet attack against Finland was stopped here. Two Soviet divisions had advanced towards Ilomantsi, and on July 21, 1944, the Red Army units were able to reach the Finnish-Soviet border of 1940. Finnish forces shattered the Soviet divisions, and those who escaped death were driven back east. This was the ninth major Finnish defence victory in only a few weeks' time. Moscow could now only decide that the Finns had plenty of fight left in them, and that they would never accept an unconditional surrender. The Finns had achieved victory, and the remnants of the two Red Army divisions had barely escaped destruction, by breaking out from the encirclements. After the battle, Stavka brought its offensive to a halt and gave up the demand of Finland’s unconditional surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME754;Disastrous Battle of Ancona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC754;We have lost the battle of Ancona!\n\nThe Battle of Ancona was a battle involving forces from Poland serving as part of the British Army and German forces that took place between 16 June and 18 July 1944 during the Italian campaign. The battle was the result of an Allied plan to capture the city of Ancona in Italy in order to gain possession of a seaport closer to the fighting so that they could shorten their lines of communication. The Polish 2nd Corps was tasked with the capture of the city on 16 June 1944, accomplishing the task a month later on 18 July 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME755;Disastrous Battle of Bologna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC755;We have lost the battle of Bologna!\n\nThe Battle of Bologna was fought from 9 to 21 April 1945. The offensive on Bologna started with a major air and artillery bombardment of the German positions, followed by an attack the same evening. The American and British units engaged the German flanks, while the Polish units broke through to the city. On 10 April, Polish forces pushed the Germans away from the Senio River. Between 12–14 April Polish forces fought the Germans at the Santerno River, and captured Imola. From 15–16 April, the Polish units fought at the Sillaro River and the Medicina Canal. On 21 April the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Brigade of the Polish 3rd Carpathian Infantry Division entered the city, where only isolated German units were still fighting. The Poles secured the city and displayed Polish flags from the town hall and the Torre Asinelli tower. The local Italian population welcomed the Poles as their liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME756;Disastrous Battle of Ortona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC756;We have lost the battle of Ortona!\n\nThe Battle of Ortona took place from December 20 to December 28, 1943, and was a small yet extremely fierce battle fought between a battalion of German Fallschirmjäger from the 1st Parachute Division and assaulting Canadian forces. The initial Canadian attack on the town was made on December 20 by the Canadian 2nd Brigade's Loyal Edmonton Regiment with elements of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada under command. Elements of the division's 3rd Infantry Brigade launched a northerly attack to the west of the town in an attempt to outflank and cut off the town's rear communications but made slow progress because of the difficult terrain and the skilful and determined German defence. After six days of intense combat the 2nd Brigade's third battalion joined the battle together with tanks from the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade's Three Rivers Regiment. On December 28 the depleted German troops finally withdrew from the town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME757;Disastrous Battle of Rimini;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC757;We have lost the battle of Rimini!\n\nThe Battle of Rimini is a name used to describe Operation Olive, the main Allied offensive on the Gothic Line in August and September 1944 during the Italian Campaign. It has been described as the biggest battle of materials ever fought in Italy. Over 1,200,000 men participated in the battle, which was a victory for the Allies although they did not achieve the hoped-for decisive breakthrough. The battle took the form of a pincer manoeuvre, carried out by the British 8th Army and U.S. 5th Army against the German Tenth and Fourteenth Armies. Rimini, a city that had been hit previously by air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces. According to the CO of the British 8th Army Sir Oliver Leese, 'The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to El Alamein, Mareth and the Gustav Line'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME758;Disastrous Battle of Breslau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC758;We have lost the battle of Breslau!\n\nThe Siege of Breslau took place from 13 February to 6 May 1945 and was a three month long Soviet siege of the city of Breslau in Lower Silesia, Germany. The German garrison's surrender on 6 May was followed the next day by the surrender of all German forces. The city was besieged as a result of the Lower Silesian Offensive during 13 February, by the 6th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front and completed the encirclement of Breslau the next day. The 1st Ukrainian Front forces besieged the city with the 22nd and 74th Rifle Corps, and the 77th Fortified Region, as well as other smaller units. The Siege of Breslau consisted of destructive house-to-house street fighting. The city was bombarded to ruin by artillery of the Soviet 6th Army, as well as the Soviet 2nd Air Army and the Soviet 18th Air Army. On 6 May, after an 82-day siege and shortly before the unconditional surrender of Germany in World War II, General Niehoff surrendered the Festung Breslau to the Soviets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME759;Disastrous Battle of Borodino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC759;We have lost the battle of Borodino!\n\nThe Battle at Borodino Field was a part of the Battle of Moskva, on the Eastern Front of World War II. At noon on 13 October 1941, German Junkers and Messerschmitt aircraft appeared over the Borodino Field. On 16 October, severe fighting broke out in the center of Borodino Field. The Germans managed to take the field, the Spaso-Borodinsky Monastery was burnt and the Borodino Museum suffered damage. The 82nd Soviet Rifle Division freed Borodino Field during the counter-offensive. A monument was later erected in the field with the inscription in bas-relief: 'Here, on the lines of the sacred Borodino Field in October, 1941 the heroic units of the 5th Army have been fighting to the bitter end, rebutting the furious onslaught of German fascist usurpers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME760;Disastrous Battle of Budapest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC760;We have lost the battle of Budapest!\n\nThe Siege of Budapest was a siege of the Hungarian capital city of Budapest, fought towards the end of World War II in Europe, during the Soviet Budapest Offensive. The siege started when the Red Army and the Romanian Army first encircled Budapest, defended by Hungarian and German troops, on 29 December 1944. The siege ended when the city was unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945. The Soviet forces besieging the city were part of Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front. Arrayed against the Soviets was a collection of German Army, Waffen-SS, and Hungarian Army forces. The Siege of Budapest was one of the bloodiest sieges of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME761;Disastrous Battle of Kerch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC761;We have lost the battle of Kerch!\n\nThe Battle of the Kerch Peninsula took place from May 8, 1942 to May 18, 1942 and was an offensive by German and Romanian armies against the Soviet Crimean Front forces defending the Kerch Peninsula, in the eastern part of the Crimea. The Red Army lost over 170,000 men killed or taken prisoner, and three armies with twenty-one divisions. The operation was one of the battles immediately preceding the German summer offensive and its successful conclusion made it possible for the Axis to launch a successful assault on Sevastopol in the following months. Some groups of Soviet survivors refused to surrender and fought on for many months, hiding in the catacombs of the quarries. Many of these soldiers were occupying the caves along with many civilians, who had fled the city of Kerch. Many of them died underground, including those who died of numerous poison gas attacks during counterattacks by the German Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME762;Disastrous Battle of Kolberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC762;We have lost the battle of Kolberg!\n\nThe Battle of Kolberg was the taking of the city of Kolberg in Pomerania by the Soviet Army and its Polish allies from Nazi German forces during the East Pomeranian Offensive. Between March 4 and March 18, 1945, there was major urban fighting between Soviet and Polish forces and the German army for control over the city. The Germans succeeded in evacuating much of their military personnel and refugees from the city via sea before the Poles took it on March 18.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME763;Disastrous Battle of Sevastopol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC763;We have lost the battle of Sevastopol!\n\nThe Siege of Sevastopol took place from 30 October 1941 to 4 July 1942 between German forces and those of the Red Army, the Black Sea Fleet and elements of the Red Air Force for control over the main Soviet Black Sea Fleet naval base. It is notable for use of German heavy artillery during the siege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME764;Disastrous Battle for Velikie Luki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC764;We have lost the battle of Velikie Luki!\n\nThe Velikiye Luki offensive operation was executed by the forces of the Red Army's Kalinin Front against the Wehrmacht’s 3rd Panzer Army during the Winter Campaign of 1942-1943 with the objective of liberating the Russian city of Velikie Luki as part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive Operation. It is particularly notable as an example of the failure of German operational combat in relieving an encirclement, similar to those employed at the Battle of Stalingrad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME765;Disastrous Battle of Voronez;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC765;We have lost the battle of Voronez!\n\nThe Battle of Voronez took place from December 1941 to 6 July 1942. The city was defended by the troops of the 40th Army as part of the Valuiki-Rossosh Defensive Operation. The German assault was conducted by elements of the 4th Panzer Army's forces of Army Group South, commanded by General Hermann Hoth. Hoth was under strict instructions not to get bogged down in street-to-street fighting. The armoured units of the 4th Panzer Army partly captured Voronez on 6 July by occupying the western river-bank suburbs. However German troops were subjected to a Red Army counter-attack. The 4th Panzer Army was to be followed by the Sixth Army, and when Voronez was occupied the former was to wheel south-eastward and move down the right bank of the Don towards Stalingrad as part of Operation Blau. It took two days for infantry divisions from Army Group South to reach Voronez to hold the line and free the Panzer troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME766;Disastrous Battle of Calais;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC766;We have lost the battle of Calais!\n\nThe Battle of Calais took place from 22 May to 26 May 1940. When the German offensive was launched in May 1940, Calais was subjected to increasingly heavy bombing, which caused disruption to military movements. On 20 May, the Germans seized Abbeville on the River Somme, capturing the last bridges over the river before the sea, and effectively isolating the BEF in Flanders and Picardy, cut off from its logistic bases. The War Office in Britain hastily despatched troops to the Channel ports, in case they were required either to re-supply the BEF or evacuate it. On the morning of 26 May, Calais Nord and the Citadel were pounded by artillery, and by 200 German bombers. About mid-afternoon, the Germans finally crossed the bridges over the canal and advanced into Calais Nord. On the other side of the harbour, they captured the Gare Maritime. The citadel was surrounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME767;Disastrous Battle of Gazala;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC767;We have lost the battle of Gazala!\n\nThe Battle of Gazala was an important battle of the Western Desert Campaign, fought around the port of Tobruk in Libya from May 26 to June 21, 1942. The combatants on the Axis side were the Panzer Army Afrika, consisting of German and Italian units and commanded by the 'Desert Fox' Colonel-General Erwin Rommel. The Allied forces were the Eighth Army, commanded by Major General Neil Ritchie under the close supervision of the Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Sir Claude Auchinleck. The battle ended in a resounding victory for the Axis. However, devoid of effective armoured forces in subsequent battles, Rommel was unable to pursue and decisively defeat the Eighth Army in Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME768;Disastrous Battle of Kassel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC768;We have lost the battle of Kassel!\n\nThe Battle of Kassel was a four-day struggle between the U.S. Army and the German Army in April 1945 for Kassel, a medium-sized city northeast of Frankfurt am Main. The battle resulted as the U.S. Third Army pushed northeast from the region of Frankfurt and Mainz. The battle opened on April 1, 1945 and ended with an American victory three days later. Opposing the Third Army's 80th Infantry Division were an infantry replacement battalion, some heavy tanks, and anti-aircraft guns. Although the Germans gave battle at Kassel, their army was on the brink of collapse as the Western Allies and the Red Army made deep inroads into Germany. The defence of Kassel did not materially impede the Allied advance, and, one month after the battle ended, Germany was forced to capitulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME769;Disastrous Battle of Tornio;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC769;We have lost the battle of Tornio!\n\nThe Battle of Tornio took place from October 1 to October 8, 1944 and was the first major engagement between Nazi Germany and Finland in the Lapland War. The Finnish Infantry Regiment 11 landed unopposed at Röyttä harbour and took the town of Tornio the same day. The German troops in town were surrounded in a few pockets until they surrendered. Further landings in Tornio the next day came under attack from Stuka bombers of the Luftwaffe, but were completed successfully despite casualties of 60 men. German counter attacks were repulsed with the aid of a battery of field artillery that was part of the second landing and fire support from Finnish gunboats. Due to lack of roads, the supplies to the troops around Kemi would have to be routed through Rovaniemi. This forced the Germans to withdraw their units from Kemi. By October 8 the whole Kemi-Tornio area had been cleared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME770;Disastrous Battle of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC770;We have lost the battle of Malta!\n\nThe Siege of Malta was a military campaign in the Mediterranean Theatre and took place from 1940 to 1942. The fight for the control of the strategically important island of Malta pitted the air forces and navies of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. From Malta, British air and sea forces could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to the Axis forces in North Africa. Malta was one of the most intensively bombed areas during the war. The German Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica flew a total of 3,000 bombing raids over a period of two years. Axis plans were made for Operation Herkules, an amphibious invasion of the island supported by airborne forces, but these were never carried out. In the end, Allied convoys were able to supply and reinforce Malta, though at great cost. This played a major role in the eventual Allied victory in North Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME771;Disastrous Battle of Grudziadz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC771;We have lost the battle of Grudziadz!\n\nThe Battle of Grudziadz took place from 1 September to 4 September 1939. It was a military engagement between German and Polish forces during the Invasion of Poland in 1939. The German XXI Corps assaulted the city on 1 September. The German 21st and 218th Infantry Divisions pushed back the Polish lines to the small river Ossa, east of Grudziadz. On 3 September elements of the German 45th Infantry Regiment managed to break into the town itself. The Germans held out there until the evening, but had to retreat when the Polish pressure increased. At the same time the Polish commander Boltuc received news that the Polish divisions on the western bank of the Vistula were facing defeat and the German forces had already crossed the Vistula in the south. This forced him to pull back his units in order to avoid being encircled soon. The Polish defenders destroyed the bridges over the Vistula and retreated to the southeast. The Germans occupied the city on 4 September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME772;Disastrous Battle of Jaroslaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC772;We have lost the battle of Jaroslaw!\n\nThe Battle of Jaroslaw took place between September 10 and September 11, 1939, in the city of Jaroslaw on the San River. During the battle the Polish forces of General Stanislaw Maczek successfully held the river crossings in the town for two days against the Nazi-German Wehrmacht, which was enough time for the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade to cross the river and retreat further eastwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME773;Disastrous Battle of Kaluszyn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC773;We have lost the battle of Kaluszyn!\n\nThe Battle of Kaluszyn took place from September 11 to September 12, 1939. German forces of the 11th Infantry Division, who managed to take the town and surround the Polish forces, overran them. The Polish aim was to retake the town and break through the German encirclement before panzer reinforcements arrived and enemy resistance stiffened. The Polish forces managed to break through the positions of the enemy 44th Infantry Regiment. An order for the 4th Squadron of the Polish 11th Uhlans Regiment to advance towards the town itself was mistakenly understood as an order for a cavalry charge and the squadron rushed towards the enemy positions. Thanks to the accidental charge the Poles broke through to the town. The Polish infantry followed into the breach in the German defences and by the early morning the town was liberated and the German division sent in retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME774;Disastrous Battle of Lódz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC774;We have lost the battle of Lódz!\n\nThe Battle of Lódz took place from September 6 to 8, 1939. By September 6, two Wehrmacht army groups had linked up at Lódz. While Lódz was under the control of the Wehrmacht, the 4th Panzer Division continued to advance east towards Warsaw. By September 8, the German advance stalled at the gates of Warsaw. The Polish Army launched a counterattack between Lódz and Warsaw in hopes off cutting off the German army's supply lines and recapturing the city of Lódz. After three days of bitter fighting, Germany defeated the desperate Polish counterattack. The city of Lódz was occupied by Germany on September 8, 1939. Recognizing the failed counterattack, all Polish forces were ordered to fall back, regroup in Eastern Poland for a last stand, and wait for aid from Great Britain and France, which would never come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME775;Disastrous Battle of Lwów;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC775;We have lost the battle of Lwów!\n\nThe Battle of Lwów was a battle for the control over the Polish city of Lwów between the Polish Army, the invading Wehrmacht and the Red Army. Soviet armoured units were pushed back after a short fight. The Soviet forces completed the encirclement of the city and joined up with the German army besieging Lwów from the west. The same day the German commander sent his envoy and demanded that the city be surrendered to Germany. When the Polish envoy replied that he had no intention of signing such a document, he was informed that the general assault was ordered on September 21 and that the city would most surely be taken. However, on September 20 the Germans left their positions to the north and south of the city, and were replaced with Soviet soldiers. On September 22, 1939, the act of surrender was signed in the suburb of Winniki.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME776;Disastrous Battle of Radom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC776;We have lost the battle of Radom!\n\nThe Battle of Radom was part of the Invasion of Poland during the Second World War. It lasted from 8 September 1939 to 9 September 1939. Polish troops of the Prusy Army, under Colonel Muzyka, defended the city of Ilza and the road from Sandomierz to Radom. The Polish infantry were eventually defeated by German armoured troops and made their last stand in an ancient castle on a hill near Ilza.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME777;Disastrous Battle of Hong Kong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC777;We have lost the battle of Hong Kong!\n\nThe Battle of Hong Kong took place during the Pacific Campaign. It began on 8 December 1941 and ended on Christmas Day with Hong Kong, then a Crown colony, surrendering to the Empire of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME778;Disastrous Battle of Ambon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC778;We have lost the battle of Ambon!\n\nThe Battle of Ambon took place from 30 January to 3 February 1942. Dutch and Australian forces resisted a Japanese invasion. From 6 January onwards, Japanese aircraft attacked Ambon. Allied aircraft made some sorties against the approaching Japanese fleet, with little success. The naval aviation base at Halong was soon rendered unusable by Japanese air raids, and was abandoned by the Dutch and US navies in mid-January. The first land attack on Laha occurred on the afternoon of 31 January. Japanese forces were also approaching the town of Ambon from the southwest and on 31 January, the Japanese captured the town. By the morning of 3 February, the Australians around Eri were struggling to cope with increasing air and naval attacks, wounded Australians, the influx of Dutch personnel, diminishing supplies and widespread fatigue. A Japanese flag had been seen flying on the other side of the bay, at Laha. The Allied position at Kudamati was surrendered separately at midday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME779;Disastrous Battle of Balikpapan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC779;We have lost the battle of Balikpapan!\n\nThe Battle of Balikpapan took place on 1 July 1945. The Australian 7th Division, composed of the 18th, 21st and 25th Infantry Brigades made an amphibious landing on the island of Borneo. Heavy bombing and shelling by Australian and US air and naval forces had preceded the landing. The Japanese were totally outnumbered and outgunned. Major operations had ceased by July 21. The 7th Division's casualties were significantly lighter than in previous campaigns. Japan surrendered while the Australians were combing the jungle for stragglers. Following the surrender the three brigades were committed to occupation duties until around February 1946. The 21st Brigade was detached to Makassar in the Celebes Islands to accept the surrender of the Japanese forces, release POWs and maintain civil order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME780;Disastrous Battle of Beirut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC780;We have lost the battle of Beirut!\n\nThe Battle of Beirut took place on 12 July 1941 and marked the end of hostilities in the Syria-Lebanon campaign. On 8 July, even before the fall of Damour, the Vichy French commander, General Henri Dentz, had sought an armistice. At one minute past midnight on 12 July a ceasefire came into effect. For all intents and purposes, this ended the campaign and an armistice was signed on 14 July at the 'Sidney Smith Barracks' on the outskirts of the city of Acre. The triumphant entry of the Australian 7th Division into Beirut successfully established the Allied occupation of Lebanon. Beirut later became an important Allied base for Mediterranean naval operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME781;Disastrous Battle of Kranj;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC781;We have lost the battle of Kranj!\n\nThe Battle of Kranj took place from 9 February to 15 February 1942. The Japanese Army assaulted the northwestern front of the British colony of Singapore with the primary objective to secure a second beachhead after their successful assault at Sarimbun Beach on 8 February, in order to breach the Jurong-Kranj defence line as part of their southward thrust towards the heart of Singapore City. Defending the shoreline between the Kranj River and the Johor-Singapore Causeway was the Australian 27th Brigade. On 10 February the Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses while moving up the Kranj River, which caused them to panic and nearly abort the operation. However, a series of miscommunications and withdrawals by Allied forces in the ensuing battles allowed the Japanese to swiftly gain strategic footholds, which eventually led to the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME782;Disastrous Battle of Wau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC782;We have lost the battle of Wau!\n\nThe Battle of Wau, 29–31 January 1943, was a battle in the New Guinea campaign. Forces of the Empire of Japan sailed from Rabaul and crossed the Solomon Sea and, despite Allied air attacks, successfully reached Lae, where they disembarked. Japanese troops then advanced overland on Wau, an Australian base that potentially threatened the Japanese positions at Salamaua and Lae. A race developed between the Japanese moving overland, hampered by the terrain, and the Australians, moving by air, hampered by the weather. By the time the Japanese reached the Wau area after a trek over the mountains, the Australian defenders had been greatly reinforced by air. In the battle that followed, despite achieving tactical surprise by approaching from an unexpected direction, the Japanese attackers were unable to capture Wau.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME783;Disastrous Battle of Singapore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC783;We have lost the battle of Singapore!\n\nThe Battle of Singapore was fought in the Southeast Asian theatre when the Empire of Japan invaded the Allied stronghold of Singapore. Singapore was the major British military base in South East Asia and nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the East'. The fighting in Singapore lasted from 8 December 1941 to 15 February 1942. It resulted in the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, and the largest surrender of British-led military personnel in history. About 80,000 British, Australian and Indian troops became prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the Malayan campaign. Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the ignominious fall of Singapore to the Japanese the 'worst disaster' and 'largest capitulation' in British history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME784;Disastrous Battle of Tarakan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC784;We have lost the battle of Tarakan!\n\nThe Battle of Tarakan was the first stage in the Borneo campaign of 1945. It began with an amphibious landing by Australian forces on 1 May, code-named Operation Oboe One. While the battle ended with success for the Allied forces over the Japanese defenders, this victory is generally regarded as having not justified its costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME785;Disastrous Battle of Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7;We have lost the battle of Berlin!\n\nThe Battle in Berlin dealt with the ever tightening ring around the German capital. The outcome of the Battle in Berlin was decided during the initial phases of the Battle of Berlin that took place outside the city. As the Soviets invested Berlin and the German forces placed to stop them were destroyed or forced back, the city's fate was sealed. Nevertheless, there was much heavy fighting within the city of Berlin as the Red Army fought its way, street by street, through to the centre of the city. On 23 April 1945, the first Soviet ground forces started to penetrate the outer suburbs of Berlin. By 27 April, Berlin was completely cut off from the outside world. The battle in the city continued until 2 May 1945. On that date, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, General Helmuth Weidling, surrendered to the commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, Lieutenant-General Vasily Chuikov. Chuikov's forces were part of Marshal Georgiy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME786;Disastrous Battle of Pegu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC786;We have lost the battle of Pegu!\n\nThe Battle of Pegu took place from 3 March to 7 March 1942. Japanese forces closed in on the British Indian Army, which was deployed near Pegu. The 'B' Squadron of the 7th Hussars arrived in the village of Payagyi to find the Japanese already there. A confused battle ensued. Then the order came for the British to move to Hlegu. Hlegu was also in Japanese hands as the British approached. The Japanese had erected a roadblock and they defended it with molotov cocktails. In the end, they were forced to retreat in the face of heavy fire from the tanks. General Alexander had realised that Rangoon was doomed, and his new plan involved a withdrawal to Prome, some 200 miles to the north. The objective, to convince the Japanese that Rangoon would be defended, had been achieved. The British Indian Army moved on to Taukkyan that evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME787;Disastrous Battle of Tampere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC787;We have lost the battle of Tampere!\n\nThe Battle of Tampere of the Finnish Civil War was fought in Finland in 1918 between Red and White forces. The White forces besieged and captured the main city of the Red Guards, Tampere, taking 10,000 Red prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME788;Disastrous Battle of Wilno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC788;We have lost the battle of Wilno!\n\nThe Battle of Wilno was one of the major battles during the Soviet invasion of Poland that accompanied the larger German invasion. During the days of 18-19 September, the Soviet forces approached and took over the major city of Wilno. The Polish forces in the area were relatively weak and the Polish commanders, unsure whether to actively oppose the Soviets, did not utilise the full defensive capabilities of the town and nearby fortified areas, although the outcome of the battle could not have been any different given the overwhelming Soviet numerical superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME789;Disastrous Battle of Palmyra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC789;We have lost the battle of Palmyra!\n\nThe Battle of Palmyra was part of the Allied invasion of Syria during the Syria-Lebanon campaign. The Habforce set off on June 21 and surrounded Palmyra. On June 28 they captured the French fort of Seba' Biyar, the small garrison surrendering without a shot fired, and the next day they occupied Sukhna. On the morning of July 1 Sukhna was attacked by the Vichy 2nd Light Desert Company. The Arab Legion occupiers had been reinforced by a squadron from 4th Cavalry Brigade's Household Cavalry Regiment and after a sharp battle, the French retreated and ended up trapped in a box valley before surrendering. Whilst hardly the largest battle of the war, its effect was to cause the 3rd Light Desert Company to lose heart and they surrendered Palmyra on the night of 2 July.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME790;Disastrous Battle of Leningrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC790;We have lost the battle of Leningrad!\n\nThe Siege of Leningrad took place from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944. It was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and the most costly in terms of casualties. It caused the greatest destruction and the largest loss of life ever known in a modern city. Most of the palaces of the Tsars and other historic landmarks located outside the city's defensive perimeter were looted and then destroyed. A number of factories, schools, hospitals and other civil infrastructure were destroyed by air raids and long-range artillery bombardment. The siege resulted in the deaths of up to 1,500,000 soldiers and civilians and the evacuation of 1,400,000. Civilians in the city suffered from extreme starvation. In January-February of 1942 about 7000-10,000 citizens died every day, most of them from hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME791;Disastrous Battle of Iwo Jima;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC791;We have lost the battle of Iwo Jima!\n\nThe Battle of Iwo Jima took place from February 19 to March 26, 1945. The United States fought for and captured Iwo Jima from Japan. The Japanese positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 km of underground tunnels. The Americans were covered by extensive naval and air support, capable of putting an enormous amount of firepower onto the Japanese positions. The U.S. invasion was charged with the mission of capturing the two airfields on Iwo Jima. Despite heavy fighting and casualties on both sides, Japanese defeat was assured from the start. The Americans possessed an overwhelming superiority in arms and numbers - this, coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, ensured that there was no plausible scenario in which the United States could have lost the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME792;Disastrous Battle of Dakar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC792;We have lost the battle of Dakar!\n\nThe Battle of Dakar was an unsuccessful attempt in September 1940 by the Allies to capture the strategic port of Dakar in French West Africa. The Allies decided to send a naval force of an aircraft carrier, two battleships, five cruisers, and ten destroyers to Dakar. The Allied fleet attacked the coastal defences, and the Vichy forces defended them. Overall, the Battle of Dakar did not go well for the Allies. The Vichy forces did not back down. During most of this conflict, bombers of the Vichy French Air Force based in North Africa bombed the British base at Gibraltar. On September 24 about 50 aircraft dropped 150 bombs while on September 25 about 100 aircraft dropped 300 bombs on the harbor and dockyards. Most of the bombs missed. Some damage but few casualties were caused. Finally, the Allies withdrew, leaving Dakar and French West Africa in Vichy hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME793;Disastrous Battle of Nanchang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC793;We have lost the battle of Nanchang!\n\nThe Battle of Nanchang was the first major conflict to occur following the Chinese defeat at the Battle of Wuhan. Nanchang was a railway center, the major supply line between the 3rd and 9th Military Regions, and site of the airbase threatening Japanese shipping in the Yangtze River. By March 27, Nanchang had fallen after being surrounded and put under siege by Japanese forces. During a period lasting until the end of April some Japanese forces were moved to support operations in other areas. This weakening of available Japanese manpower had consequences. On April 21, a surprise attack by the forces of the 3rd and 9th Military Regions allowed for a breakthrough by the 32nd Army Group that allowed a Chinese spearhead to reach the outer area of Nanchang in 5 days. However, under heavy attack from Japanese Aviation and facing a Japanese garrison reinforced by components of the Navy they were unable to lay an effective siege and retreated on May 9.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME794;Disastrous First Battle of Guam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC794;We have lost the first battle of Guam!\n\nThe First Battle of Guam took place from December 8 to December 10, 1941 between Japanese and American forces. On December 8, Japanese aircraft from Saipan attacked Guam. On December 10, the 5th Company landed on Dungcas Beach on Agana Bay north of Agana, attacked and quickly captured the Insular Force Guard in Agana. It then advanced on Piti, moving toward Sumay and the Marine Barracks. The South Seas Detachment began landing on the north flank of Tumon Bay on the upper northwest coast and moved towards Agana. The principal engagement took place on Agana's Plaza de España when a few Marines and Insular Force Guardsmen fought with the 5th Company. After token resistance, the Marines and Governor McMillin surrendered. No further fighting took place, but a few skirmishes took place all over the island before news of the surrender spread and the rest of the island forces surrendered as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME795;Disastrous Second Battle of Guam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC795;We have lost the second battle of Guam!\n\nThe Second Battle of Guam took place from July 21 to August 8, 1944 and was the American capture of the Japanese-held island of Guam during the Pacific Campaign. On July 21 the Americans landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam. Japanese counter-attacks were made throughout the first few days of the battle, mostly at night, using infiltration tactics. Several times they penetrated the American defences and were driven back with heavy loss of men and equipment. The counterattacks around the American beachheads had exhausted the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a handful of tanks left. After an engagement at Mount Barrigada from August 2 to August 4, the Japanese line collapsed and the rest of the battle was a pursuit to the north. As in other battles of the Pacific War, the Japanese refused to surrender, and almost all were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME796;Disastrous Battle of Rabaul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC796;We have lost the battle of Rabaul!\n\nThe Battle of Rabaul took place in January and February 1942. In January 1942, Rabaul came under attack by large numbers of Japanese carrier-based aircraft. On 21 January, eight Wirraways attacked a formation of 109 Japanese aircraft. Three RAAF planes were shot down, two crash-landed, and another was damaged. As a result of the intense air attacks, Australian coastal artillery was destroyed and Australian infantry were withdrawn from Rabaul itself. Rabaul became the biggest Japanese base in New Guinea. The Australians tried to restrict its development soon after its capture by a bombing counter attack in March. In December 1943, during the Battle of Cape Gloucester, U.S. Marines landed in western New Britain and consequent Allied operations on New Britain gradually restricted the Japanese force to Rabaul. However, a large number of Japanese personnel remained in Rabaul until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME797;Disastrous First Battle of Changsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC797;We have lost the first battle of Changsha!\n\nThe First Battle of Changsha took place from September 17, 1939 to October 6, 1939 and was the first attempt by Japan to take the city of Changsha, China. The Japanese launched the attacks on September 17, when their forces in northern Jiangxi attacked westward toward Henan. However, the Japanese stretched too far out westward and were counter-attacked by Chinese forces from the south and the north, forcing them to retreat eastward. On September 23 the Japanese drove the Chinese out of the Sinchiang river area. Heavy fighting continued after the 23rd and the Chinese retreated southward to distract the Japanese while supporting battalions arrived in the east and the west for an encirclement maneuver. On September 29 the Japanese reached the outskirts of Changsha. However, they were unable to conquer the city because the Chinese cut off their supply lines. By October 6 the Japanese forces at Changsha were decimated while the remnants retreated northward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME798;Disastrous Second Battle of Changsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC798;We have lost the second battle of Changsha!\n\nThe Second Battle of Changsha took place from September 6 to October 8, 1941 and was Japan's second attempt at taking the city of Changsha. The battle started when a small Chinese guerrilla force clashed with the Japanese 6th Division in the mountains southeast of Yueyang on September 6th. On the 17th, the Japanese crossed the Sinchiang River at four points and made rapid advances, crossing the Milo River on the 19th. The main Chinese force avoided confronting the enemy but marched in a parallel fashion flanking the Japanese trail southward. The Chinese and the Japanese army reached the Laotao River regions for an inevitable battle. On September 27th, several hundred Japanese troops in plain clothes reached the north gate of Changsha but were unable to sabotage the city defences, leading to heavy fighting on the 28th. Unable to overcome the defenders, the Japanese began a general retreat back to the Yueyang region on September 30th.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME799;Disastrous Third Battle of Changsha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC799;We have lost the third battle of Changsha!\n\nThe Third Battle of Changsha was the third attempt by the Japanese to invade the Chinese province of Hunan. In June 1944 the Japanese deployed 360,000 troops to invade Changsha. On 27 May, 1944, the Japanese 11th Army launched the 1944 general offensive toward Changsha as scheduled. The Japanese flanked the Chinese troops defending Changsha and cut off their possible retreat routes, and placed some secondary divisions in charge of attacking Changsha. The Chinese attempted to use the previous tactic of avoiding direct contact by marching in parallel fashion to flank the Japanese, but were unable to encircle the enemy like before and had to retreat. This allowed the IJA to rapidly ransack the city of Changsha, breaking the defences of the infantry within the city, as well as neutralizing the Chinese artillery on Yuelu Mountain, and Changsha was quickly lost to the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME800;Effective Bombing of Wielun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC800;We have successfully bombed Wielun!\n\nThe Bombing of Wielun refers to the indiscriminate bombing of the Polish town of Wielun by the German Luftwaffe on 1 September 1939. The Luftwaffe started bombing Wielun five minutes before the shelling of Westerplatte, which has traditionally been considered the beginning of World War II. It is considered to be one of the first terror bombings in history and the first in Europe in this war. It killed an estimated 1,300 civilians, injured hundreds more and destroyed 90 percent of the town centre. It is widely acknowledged that there were no targets of any importance in the area such as military installations or industrial facilities. The casualty rate was more than twice as high as Guernica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB800;Great work men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME801;Effective Bombing of Guernica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC801;We have successfully bombed Guernica!\n\nThe Bombing of Guernica took place on April 26, 1937 and was an aerial attack on the Basque town of Guernica, causing widespread destruction and civilian deaths during the Spanish Civil War. The raid by planes of the German Luftwaffe 'Condor Legion' and the Italian Fascist Aviazione Legionaria was called Operation Rügen. The Basque government reported 1,654 people killed, but modern research suggests between 200 to 400 civilians died. Western countries viewed Guernica as an example of terror bombing and gained the impression that the Luftwaffe was committed to that tactic. The bombing was the subject of a famous anti-war painting by Pablo Picasso.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME802;Effective Bombing of London;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC802;We have successfully bombed London!\n\nThe Battle of Britain was the air campaign waged by the German Air Force against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign until that date. From July 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres such as Portsmouth were the main targets. One month later the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing tactics. The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender is considered its first major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME803;Effective Bombing of Chongqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC803;We have successfully bombed Chongqing!\n\nThe bombing of Chongqing took place from 18 February 1938 to 23 August 1943 and was part of an Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service terror bombing operation on the Chinese provisional capital of Chongqing. A conservative estimate places the number of bombing runs at more than 5,000, with more than 11,500 bombs dropped, mainly incendiary bombs. The bombing of Chongqing was focused almost entirely on the civilian population. In the first two days of the campaign, the raids of May 1939 killed more than five thousand Chinese civilians. Two months later, after tens of thousands of deaths, in retaliation for firebombing, the United States embargoed the export of airplane parts to Japan, thus imposing its first economic sanction against Japan. Three thousand tons of bombs were launched on the city between 1939 and 1942. A total of 268 air raids were conducted against Chongqing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME804;Effective Bombing of Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC804;We have successfully bombed Berlin!\n\nThe Air Battle of Berlin took place from November 1943 to March 1944. Between November 1943 and March 1944 Bomber Command made 16 massed attacks on Berlin. The Battle of Berlin was a failure for the Royal Air Force as it was not the knockout blow that Air Chief Marshal Harris had predicted and during the battle, the RAF lost 1,047 bombers, with a further 1,682 damaged, and well over 7,000 aircrew, culminating in the raid on Nuremberg on 30 March 1944, when 94 bombers were shot down and 71 damaged, out of 795 aircraft. There were many other raids on Berlin by the RAF and the USAAF Eighth Air Force in the strategic bombing campaign of 1940–1945 and this is reflected in the RAF battle honour, which is for bombardment of Berlin, by aircraft of Bomber Command 1940–1945. Prior to the battle of Berlin, Berlin had been subject to a large raid on 23/24 August of 700+ aircraft. A raid half that size, losing 7% of the aircraft, had taken place in September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME805;Effective Bombing of Helsinki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC805;We have successfully bombed Helsinki!\n\nHelsinki was bombed several times during World War II. Finland fought three wars between 1939–1945, two against the Soviet Union and one against Germany. The largest raids were three raids in February 1944, which have been called the Great raids against Helsinki. Helsinki's air defences prioritised stopping bombs from reaching the city over the destruction of air targets. Thanks to the efficiency of the anti-aircraft and bluffing measures, the damage caused by the great raids was limited. Only 5% of the bombs fell on the city and some of these in parks. Some 2,000 bombers participated in the three great raids on Helsinki and dropped some 2,600 tons of bombs. Of the 146 who died, six were soldiers. 356 were wounded, 109 buildings were destroyed, shrapnel damaged 300 and 111 were ignited by the bombs. The Soviets lost 25 aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME806;Effective Bombing of Tallinn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC806;We have successfully bombed Tallinn!\n\nThe Soviet Long Range Aviation bombed the Estonian capital Tallinn several times during World War II. First of the instances was during the Summer War of 1941, a part of Operation Barbarossa. A number of bombing missions followed in 1942–43. The largest of the bombings occurred in March 1944 in connection with the Battle of Narva. Thousands of Soviet bombs set the town on fire, killed 463 people, wounded 659, and left 25,000 people without a shelter in the winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME807;Effective Bombing of Lübeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC807;We have successfully bombed Lübeck!\n\nLübeck was bombed for the first time by the Royal Air Force on the night of 28/29 March 1942. On the Saturday night of 28 March 1942 234 Wellington and Stirling bombers dropped about 400 tons of bombs including 25,000 incendiary devices over Lübeck. There were few defences, so many crews attacked at 600 metres. The attack took place in three waves. The first consisted of experienced crews in aircraft fitted with Gee electronic navigation systems. Blockbuster bombs in the first wave of the raid opened the brick and copper roofs of the buildings and the following incendiaries set them afire. 1,468 buildings in Lübeck were destroyed, 2,180 were seriously damaged and 9,103 were lightly damaged. The bombing of Lübeck struck a corridor about 300 metres (330 yards) wide from Lübeck Cathedral to St. Peter's Church, the town hall and St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. The German police reported 301 dead, 3 persons missing and 783 injured. More than 15,000 lost their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME808;Effective Bombing of Darwin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC808;We have successfully bombed Darwin!\n\nThe Japanese air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 were the largest attacks ever mounted by a foreign power against Australia. The raids were the first of almost 100 air raids against Australia during 1942–43. This event is often called the 'Pearl Harbor of Australia'. Although it was a less significant military target, a greater number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than were used in the attack on Pearl Harbor. As was the case at Pearl Harbor, the Australian town was unprepared, and although it came under attack from the air another 58 times in 1942 and 1943, the raids on 19 February were massive and devastating by comparison. Darwin had a population of about 2,000 at the time, the normal civilian population of about 5,000 having been reduced by evacuation. It was a strategically placed naval port and airbase, and there were about 15,000 Allied soldiers in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME809;Successful Attack on Pearl Harbor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC809;We have successfully bombed Pearl Harbor!\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was an unannounced military strike conducted by the Japanese navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack consisted of two aerial attack waves totalling 353 aircraft, launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers and sank four U.S. Navy battleships and damaged the other four battleships present. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer, destroyed 188 aircraft, and caused personnel losses of 2,402 killed and 1,282 wounded. Japanese losses were light, with 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. One Japanese sailor was captured. Germany's ill-advised declaration of war on the U.S., which was not required by any treaty commitment, moved the U.S. from clandestine support of Britain into active alliance and full participation in the European Theatre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME810;Successful Atomic Bombing on Hiroshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC810;We have successfully bombed Hiroshima!\n\nDuring the final stages of World War II in 1945, the United States conducted two atomic bombings against Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After six months of intense strategic firebombing of 67 Japanese cities the Japanese government ignored an ultimatum given by the Potsdam Declaration. By executive order of President Harry S. Truman the U.S. dropped the nuclear weapon ‘Little Boy’ on the city of Hiroshima on Monday, August 6, 1945, followed by the detonation of ‘Fat Man’ over Nagasaki on August 9. Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, on August 15, Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending the Pacific War and therefore World War II. Germany had signed its unavoidable Instrument of Surrender on May 7, ending the war in Europe. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan adopting the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME811;Effective Bombing of Wewak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC811;We have successfully bombed Wewak!\n\nThe Bombing of Wewak was a series of air raids by the USAAF Fifth Air Force, on August 17-18 1943, against the major air base of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force on the mainland of New Guinea, at Wewak. The raid was a great success for the Allies: the Japanese Fourth Air Army lost about 100 planes on the ground, reducing its operational strength to about 30 planes. Only three aircraft from the U.S. Fifth Air Force were lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME812;Successful Attack on Broome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC812;We have successfully bombed Broome!\n\nJapanese fighter planes attacked the town of Broome in Western Australia on 3 March 1942. Lieutenant Zenjiro Miyano led nine Mitsubishi Zeroes and a Mitsubishi C5M2 reconnaissance plane from their base at Kupang, Timor in the attack, on the morning of 3 March. From about 9.20am, the Zeroes made strafing attacks on the flying boat anchorage at Roebuck Bay and the Royal Australian Air Force base at Broome Airfield. The Japanese fighters destroyed at least 22 Allied aircraft. At the airfield the Japanese fighters destroyed two B-17E Flying Fortresses and a B-24 belonging to the USAAF, two Lockheed Hudsons belonging to the RAAF and a Lockheed Lodestar belonging to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force. Japanese aircraft later made several smaller attacks on the Broome area. On 20 March, Mitsubishi G4M heavy bombers made a high altitude attack on the airfield. One civilian was killed and there was some crater damage. The last attack was in August 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME813;Victorious Belfast Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC813;We have successfully bombed Belfast!\n\nThe Belfast Blitz was an event that occurred on the night of Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941. Two hundred bombers of the German Air Force attacked the city of Belfast in Northern Ireland. Nearly one thousand people died as a result of the bombing and even more were injured. In terms of property damage, half of the houses in Belfast were damaged. Outside of the city of London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the blitz. Roughly 100,000 people of a total population of 425,000 were left homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME814;Victorious Minsk Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC814;We have successfully bombed Minsk!\n\nThe Minsk Blitz was the heavy bombing of the city of Minsk in the USSR. During 24 June 1941 three waves of bombers, of 47 aircraft each, bombed Minsk. The anti-aircraft defence of the city was poorly organized, and panic ensued. Because the water supply was destroyed, fires could not be put down. Inhabitants left the city. As much as 85% of the city's buildings and the entire infrastructure was destroyed. More than 1,000 people were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME815;Effective Bombing of Warszawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC815;We have successfully bombed Warszawa!\n\nThe Bombing of Warszawa refers both to the terror bombing campaign of Warszawa by the Luftwaffe during the siege of Warszawa in the Invasion of Poland in 1939 and to the German bombing raids during the Warszawa Uprising in 1944. In the course of the war approximately 84% of the city was destroyed in part due to German mass bombings, heavy artillery fire and a planned demolition campaign. During the September campaign the Luftwaffe used all available aircraft to drop bombs on Warszawa since the beginning of the war, including even obsolete Junkers Ju-52/3m bombers. About 1,150 bombing sorties by German aircraft were flown against Warszawa on September 25 1939, in an effort to terrorize the defenders into surrendering. 500 tons of high explosive bombs and 72 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped on the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME816;Effective Bombing of Innsbruck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC816;We have successfully bombed Innsbruck!\n\nThe Austrian city Innsbruck was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. It was bombed 21 times by the Allies in World War II, suffering heavy damage. Widespread area bombing of Innsbruck began in 1943 and went on until 1945. The Innsbruck cathedral, the Wilten train station and the Maria-Theresienstrasse were destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME817;Effective Bombing of Amiens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC817;We have successfully bombed Amiens!\n\nOperation Jericho was a low-level bombing raid by Allied aircraft on Amiens Prison in German-occupied France on 18 February 1944. The object of the raid was to free French Resistance and political prisoners, 120 of whom were to be executed the following day. Mosquito bombers succeeded in breaching the walls and buildings of the prison, as well as destroying guards' barracks. Of the 717 prisoners, 102 were killed, 74 wounded, and 258 escaped, including 79 Resistance and political prisoners, although two thirds were recaptured. One of the inmates was also privy to sensitive information concerning Operation Overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME818;Effective Bombing of Kassel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC818;We have successfully bombed Kassel!\n\nThe Kassel bombings were a set of Allied strategic bombing attacks. The fire of the most severe air raid burned for seven days, at least 10,000 people died, 150,000 inhabitants were bombed-out, and the city center was 95% destroyed. The US First Army captured Kassel in March 1945 and only 50,000 people were in residence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME819;Effective Bombing of Coventry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC819;We have successfully bombed Coventry!\n\nThe Coventry Blitz was a series of bombing raids that took place in the English city of Coventry. The city was bombed many times during the Second World War by the Nazi German Air Force. The most devastating of these blitzes occurred on the evening of 14 November 1940. The British and the Germans were fighting the Battle of the Beams and on this night the British failed to disrupt the X-Gerät signals. The final air raid on Coventry came on 3 August 1942, in the Stoke Heath district approximately one mile to the east of the city centre, and six people were killed. By the time of this air raid, some 1,250 people had died in Coventry as a result of air raids. Around 80% of them had been killed in the raids of 14/15 November 1940 and 8-10 April 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME820;Effective Bombing of Kobenhavn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC820;We have successfully bombed Kobenhavn!\n\nOperation Carthage was a controversial British air raid on Kobenhavn, Denmark. The target of the raid was the Shellhus Gestapo headquarters in the city centre, a building that had been used for the storage of dossiers and the torture of Danish citizens. Members of the Danish resistance movement in the hope of freeing imprisoned members and destroying Gestapo records requested the raid. Unfortunately, a Mosquito in the first wave hit a lamppost and crashed into a school near the Shellhus, and the third wave of bombers attacked the burning school thinking it was their target. 125 Danish civilians died in the school, including 86 schoolchildren. The raid succeeded in destroying Gestapo headquarters and severely disrupting Gestapo operations in Denmark, as well as allowing the escape of 18 Gestapo prisoners. Four Mosquito F.B.VI bombers and two Mustang F.III were lost, and nine crewmembers died on the British side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME821;Effective Bombing of Oslo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC821;We have successfully bombed Oslo!\n\nThe Oslo Mosquito raid on 25 September 1942 was a British air raid on Oslo in Norway. The target of the raid was the Victoria Terrasse building, the headquarters of the Gestapo. The bombers crossed the North Sea at heights of less than 30 m to avoid interception by enemy aircraft and navigated by dead reckoning. At least four bombs penetrated the Gestapo HQ. One failed to detonate while the other three crashed out through the opposite wall before exploding. The building was not destroyed, but several civilian residences were, and 80 civilians were killed and injured. The Norwegian government in exile, which did not know about the raid, later expressed serious concern to the British government. Official announcements by the German occupation forces claimed that several British aircraft had been shot down, when in reality a single Mosquito had been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME822;Effective Bombing of Schweinfurt-Regensburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC822;We have successfully bombed Schweinfurt-Regensburg!\n\nThe Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission was an air combat battle flown by B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Army Air Forces on August 17 1943. It was conceived as an ambitious plan to cripple the German aircraft industry. The Luftwaffe also knew the mission as the ‘double-strike mission’ because it entailed two large forces of bombers attacking separate targets in order to disperse fighter reaction. The mission inflicted heavy damage on the Regensburg target, but at catastrophic loss to the force, with 60 bombers lost and many more damaged beyond economical repair. As a result, the Eighth Air Force was unable to follow up immediately with a second attack that might have seriously crippled German industry. When Schweinfurt was finally attacked again two months later, the lack of long-range fighter escort had still not been addressed and losses were almost as high. As a consequence, deep penetration strategic bombing was curtailed for five months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME823;Victorious Swansea Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC823;We have successfully bombed Swansea!\n\nThe Swansea Blitz was the heavy and sustained bombing of Swansea by the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany on 19 February-21 February 1941. Swansea was selected as a legitimate target due to its importance as a port and docks and its destruction was key to Nazi German war efforts as part of their strategic bombing campaign aimed at crippling coal export and demoralising civilians and emergency services. The first air raid on Swansea was early on the morning of 27 June 1940, at 3.30 AM. On the last night the air raid sirens sounded at 7.50 pm - the start of a raid that lasted for five hours. Incendiary bombs were dropped over Swansea and the town centre was engulfed in a firestorm of flames. The grammar school that had stood on Mount Pleasant Hill since 1851 took a direct hit and was completely destroyed. 270 city residents died and 409 were injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME824;Effective Bombing of Hamamatsu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC824;We have successfully bombed Hamamatsu!\n\nThe Bombing of Hamamatsu was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States of America against military and civilian targets and population centers of the Empire of Japan. Hamamatsu was a major transportation hub on the Tokaido Main Line railway connecting Tokyo with Osaka and had several targets of military significance. It was the location of armaments factories, including Showa Yakuhin, Nakajima Aircraft Company and Suzuki Motors. It was also the location of the Hamamatsu Flight School of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and a major military airfield. Hamamatsu was situated on the main flight route from Saipan to either Nagoya or Tokyo and was thus often assigned as a secondary target. In addition to strategic bombing, Hamamatsu was subject to tactical air raids launched by United States Navy carrier-based aircraft, and coastal areas to occasional bombardment by United States and Royal Navy vessels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME825;Effective Bombing of Numazu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC825;We have successfully bombed Numazu!\n\nThe Bombing of Numazu was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States of America against military and civilian targets and population centers during the Japan home islands campaign. Although the city of Numazu was not a major population center, it had a number of targets of military significance centered on its port facility. Numazu was bombed eight times during World War II, the largest air raid occurring on the night of July 17, 1945. During this attack, 130 B-29 Superfortress bombers of the USAAF 20th Air Force, 58th Bombardment Wing dropped a total of 1,039 tons of incendiary bombs on the city, resulting in a firestorm which destroyed most of the city. The estimated civilian casualties were 274 people killed, and 9,523 homes destroyed in this raid. However, total casualties came to 322 killed, 634 severely injured, and 11,883 homes destroyed over the course of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME826;Effective Bombing of Tokyo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC826;We have successfully bombed Tokyo!\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo by the United States Army Air Forces took place at several times during the Pacific campaigns of World War II and included the most destructive bombing raid in history. The first raid on Tokyo was the Doolittle Raid of 18 April 1942, when sixteen B-25 Mitchells attacked Yokohama and Tokyo. The raid did no damage to Japan's war capability but was a significant propaganda victory for the United States. The US Strategic Bombing Survey later estimated that nearly 88,000 people died, 41,000 were injured, and over a million residents lost their homes. The Tokyo Fire Department estimated a higher toll: 97,000 killed and 125,000 wounded. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department established a figure of 124,711 casualties including both killed and wounded and 286,358 buildings and homes destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME827;Effective Bombing of Braunschweig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC827;We have successfully bombed Braunschweig!\n\nThe Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II on the night of 14/15 October 1944 by No. 5 Group Royal Air Force marked the high point of the destruction of Henry the Lion's city in the Second World War. The air raid, part of Operation Hurricane, caused a huge firestorm because of which Braunschweig burnt continuously for two and a half days. Moreover, the attack destroyed Braunschweig's mediaeval city centre thereby changing the city's appearance right down to the present day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME828;Effective Bombing of Augsburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC828;We have successfully bombed Augsburg!\n\nThe Bombing of Augsburg included one British RAF and two USAAF bombing raids against the German city of Augsburg on 17 April 1942 and 25/26 February 1944. RAF Bomber Command targeted the Augsburg MAN U-boat diesel engine factory on April 17, 1942. Only two of the first formation of Lancasters dropped their four 1,000 lb bombs on the factory. Five of the next dropped their bombs. 8 machine tools were destroyed out of a total of 2,700, and 5 cranes out of 558. Of the 84 RAF airmen, 37 died and 12 were taken as prisoners of war. In a final Big Week mission, the Eighth Air Force bombed the Augsburg Messerschmitt works during the day of 25 February 1944. That night, 25/26 February 1944, RAF Bomber Command followed with 594 aircraft and completely destroyed the centre of Augsburg. 21 RAF aircraft, 3.6 per cent of the force, was lost, at least 4 due to collision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME829;Effective Bombing of Bremen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC829;We have successfully bombed Bremen!\n\nThe Bombing of Bremen by the Royal Air Force and the Eighth Air Force targeted strategic targets in the state of Bremen, which had heavy anti-aircraft artillery but only 35 fighter aircraft in the area. In addition to Wesermünde/Bremerhaven, targets were also in Farge and Vegesack. Bremen also included concentration camps such as Bremen-Farge and Bremen-Vegesack. The city of Bremen was captured in April 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME830;Effective Bombing of Darmstadt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC830;We have successfully bombed Darmstadt!\n\nThe most devastating air raid on Darmstadt occurred on the night of 11/12 September 1944 when the Royal Air Force bombed the city. On the night of 23/24 September 1943 21 Avro Lancasters and eight De Havilland Mosquitos of No. 8 Group RAF bombed Darmstadt. An attack on the night of 25/26 August 1944 by 90 Lancasters and six Mosquitos of the RAF was a failure, because the pathfinders' flares were dropped too far to the west. 95 buildings were hit in Darmstadt and the scattered bombs, which did hit the town, killed eight people. The main raid on Darmstadt was by No. 5 Group RAF on the night of the 11/12 September 1944, when 226 Lancasters and 14 Mosquitos started a fierce fire in the centre and in the districts immediately to the south and east. Property damage in this area was almost complete. The raid killed an estimated 12,300 inhabitants and rendered 66,000 homeless. The RAF lost 12 Lancasters, 5.3 per cent of the Lancaster force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME831;Effective Bombing of Dresden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC831;We have successfully bombed Dresden!\n\nThe Bombing of Dresden was a military bombing by the British Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Force as part of the allied forces between 13 February and 15 February 1945. In four raids, 1,300 heavy bombers dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city, the Baroque capital of the German state of Saxony. The resulting firestorm destroyed 39 square kilometres of the city centre. In the first few decades after the war, some death toll estimates were as high as 250,000. However, figures in the hundreds of thousands are now considered unreasonable. Today's historians estimate a death toll between 24,000 and 40,000, and an independent investigation commissioned by the city council in 2006 determined a minimum of 18,000 victims with a maximum total number of fatalities of around 25,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME832;Victorious Cardiff Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC832;We have successfully bombed Cardiff!\n\nThe Cardiff Docks was one of the biggest ports in the United Kingdom, and one of the largest and busiest coal exporting ports in the World. Consequently, the Nazi German Luftwaffe heavily bombed it. The bombing in 1941 damaged Llandaff Cathedral, amongst many other civilian buildings caught in the raids. Cork in Ireland was mistaken for Cardiff due to a night flying navigational error and consequently bombed. In 1940 Luftwaffe raids occurred on 3 July, 10 July, 12 July and 7 August. Following the Battle of Britain, Cardiff again saw bombing on at least a dozen days from the New Year to the spring of 1941. In 1942, two more raids took place, on 30 June and 2 July. In 1943 two of the last raids occurred on 7 May and 18 May.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME833;Effective Bombing of Dublin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC833;We have successfully bombed Dublin!\n\nThe Bombing of Dublin took place on 31 May 1941. The German Air Force bombed Dublin, the capital of neutral Ireland, killing 34 persons. Despite its neutrality, Ireland had not been totally spared German air bombardment before the Dublin raid. On 26 August 1940, German bombs were dropped on County Wexford, the bombs hitting Duncormick and Ambrosetown doing no discernible damage. On 20 December 1940, German bombs hit Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, and Dun Laoghaire and the Sandycove railway station, both near Dublin. On 1 January 1941, German bombs hit Duleek and Julianstown, without casualties. On 2 January 1941, German bombs hit Terenure in Dublin and Ballymurn. Dublin itself was hit without damage or casualties, and the nearby Curragh Racecourse was hit with incendiary devices, and other bombs hit County Wicklow. German bombs also destroyed a house in Knockroe, killing three persons. On 3 January 1941, German bombers hit Dublin again, this time injuring 20 persons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME834;Effective Bombing of Duisburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC834;We have successfully bombed Duisburg!\n\nDuisburg was bombed a number of times by the Allies during World War II. The most devastating air raids on Duisburg occurred during October 1944 when the Royal Air Force bombed the city. Duisburg was a major logistical centre in the Ruhr Area and the location of chemical, steel and iron industries. Duisburg was a primary target of Allied bombers, which attacked not only the industrial areas but also residential areas. As an entry to the Ruhr, there were daily warnings of bombing raids in 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME835;Effective Bombing of Frankfurt am Main;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC835;We have successfully bombed Frankfurt!\n\nThe city of Frankfurt am Main was severely bombed by the Allies during World War II. The city's centre was destroyed by numerous air raids and about 5,500 residents were killed. The once famous medieval city centre, then the largest in Germany, was destroyed. The historic Paulskirche, a site of great historic significance for Germany, was destroyed during these bombardments. On 29 January 1944, the USAAF Eighth Air Force bombed Frankfurt during the daylight. It was on that date that Princess Marie Alexandra of Baden was killed in an air raid on Frankfurt. Later in 1944, on 22 March, a Royal Air Force attack destroyed the old part of Frankfurt and over 1,000 inhabitants died. Additionally, the east port, which was a significant shipping point for bulk goods with its own rail connection, suffered major damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME836;Effective Bombing of Hamburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC836;We have successfully bombed Hamburg!\n\nThe Allied Bombing of Hamburg took place from September 1939 to April 1945. As a large port and industrial center, Hamburg's shipyards, U-boat pens, and the Hamburg-Harburg area oil refineries were attacked throughout the war. The attack during the last week of July 1943, Operation Gomorrah, created one of the greatest firestorms raised by the RAF and United States Army Air Force in WWII, killing roughly 50,000 civilians in Hamburg and practically destroying the entire city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME837;Effective Bombing of Leipzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC837;We have successfully bombed Leipzig!\n\nLeipzig was repeatedly attacked in British as well as American air raids. The most severe attack was launched by the Royal Air Force in the early hours of December 4, 1943 and claimed more than 1,800 lives. Large parts of the city center were destroyed, while factories experienced temporary shortfalls in production, had to move production facilities or even were decentralized. At the outbreak of the war, Leipzig had more than 700,000 inhabitants and was therefore the sixth-largest city of the “Greater German Reich”. Leipzig additionally had outstanding significance as the exhibition center of the German Reich. The Erla Flugzeugwerke aircraft factories that produced fighter planes at the three locations of Heiterblick, Abtnaundorf and Mockau were immediately important for the strategic warfare. Additionally, Leipzig was an important railroad intersection in Germany at that time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME838;Effective Bombing of Zadar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC838;We have successfully bombed Zadar!\n\nThe Bombing of Zadar by the Allies lasted from November 1943 to October 1944. Although other large cities in Italy were also bombed, the bombing of Zara stands out because of the number of attacks and the number of fatalities. Reports vary greatly, as the Allies documented 30 bombing raids while contemporary Italian accounts claim 54. Fatalities recorded range from under 1,000 up to as many as 4,000 of the city's 20,000 inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME839;Effective Bombing of Zagreb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC839;We have successfully bombed Zagreb!\n\nThe Bombing of Zagreb was carried out by the Allies from 1943 until 1945 at the request of the Yugoslav Partisans. Over the course of the bombing the areas of Crnomerec, Borongaj and Pleso were hit the hardest. On February 22, 1944 a Dominican monastery was hit by the bombing, resulting in the deaths of eight theology students. In response to these deaths, archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac sent a letter to the British ambassador to the Holy See. On May 30, 1944 100 bombs were dropped on Borongaj, each weighing 250 kg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME840;Victorious Southampton Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC840;We have successfully bombed Southampton!\n\nThe Southampton Blitz was the heavy bombing of Southampton by The Nazi German Luftwaffe. Southampton was a large port city on the south coast of Great Britain and it was an important strategic target for the German Luftwaffe. Over 30,000 incendiary devices were dropped on the city. Nearly 45,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Of the 57 air raids, by far the worst were on 23 and 30 November, and 1 December. These attacks are generally referred to as Southampton's Blitz. Southampton lost seven churches during the blitz, as well as the nearby Audit House, the Ordnance Survey offices and many shops, factories and homes. The last casualties of air raids in the city were in a small raid on the suburbs of the city in May 1941. The last major raid of over 50 bombers was in June 1942, after which the worst was over. There were occasional single bombs and in 1944 the only two V1 flying bombs to land on the city were the last to fall in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME841;Effective Bombing of Stuttgart;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC841;We have successfully bombed Stuttgart!\n\nThe bombing of Stuttgart was a series of 53 air raids, the first one occurring on August 25, 1940. Both the RAF and the 8th Air Force repeatedly attacked the city over the next four and one-half years. Stuttgart was heavily attacked by the RAF raid of March 15,1944, in which 863 bombers dropped 3,000 tons of bombs. The Allied air forces struck Stuttgart four times between July 25 and July 29, dropping some 73,000 bombs on the city. In September, the city was attacked by raids of over 200 aircraft. The September 12 raid resulted in a firestorm that caused extensive damage and 957 deaths. During the night of October 19/20 1944, 583 aircraft bombed the city. This was followed on November 5 by two raids that totalled 165 bombers. The last large raid of 1944 was with 350 aircraft against eastern Stuttgart on December 9. The final large raid of the war was on January 28 1945, in which 539 aircraft bombed eastern Stuttgart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME842;Effective Second Bombing of Schweinfurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC842;We have successfully bombed Schweinfurt!\n\nThe second Schweinfurt raid attacked ball bearing factories and became known as Black Thursday because of the worst USAAF losses to that date: 77 bombers and about 650 crewmembers. Out of 2,900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although 65 survived as POWs. Five were killed and forty-three wounded in the damaged aircraft that made it home, and 594 were listed as missing in action. Only thirty-three bombers landed without damage. The 306th Bomb Group lost 100 men: 35 died on the mission or of wounds, and 65 were captured. The 305th Bomb Group lost 130 men with 36 killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME843;Effective Bombing of Podgorica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC843;We have successfully bombed Podgorica!\n\nOn April 6 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had been invaded by the Axis powers. The Bombing of Podgorica was carried out by the Allies from 1943 until 1944 at the request of the Yugoslav Partisans. The Podgorica airfield was bombed by P-39 Airacobras of the USAAF's Twelfth Air Force on October 25, 1943. The most intense bombing of Podgorica occurred on May 5, 1944. 116 USAAF B-24 Liberators participated in the attack, which dropped 270 tonnes of bombs on the city. The attack resulted in only four German casualties and approximately 100 Chetnik deaths, while 400 Montenegrin civilians were killed. On November 6, 72 RAF planes bombed the city. It was reported that 700 German troops were killed in the attack. On November 7, 124 P-38s strafed Axis troop concentrations in and around the city. The Allied bombing almost completely destroyed the city of Podgorica. Approximately 4,100 people died in the attacks. Partisans took over the city on December 19, 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME844;Effective Bombing of Pforzheim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC844;We have successfully bombed Pforzheim!\n\nDuring the latter stages of World War II, Pforzheim, a town in southwestern Germany, was bombed a number of times. The Royal Air Force carried out the largest raid, and one of the most devastating area bombardments of the war on the evening of February 23, 1945. 31.4% of the town's population, up to 17,600 people, was killed in the air raid. About 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed, two-thirds of the complete area of Pforzheim and between 80 and 100% of the inner city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME845;Victorious Plymouth Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC845;We have successfully bombed Plymouth!\n\nThe Plymouth Blitz was a series of bombing raids carried out by the Nazi German Luftwaffe on the English city of Plymouth. The royal dockyards at HMNB Devonport were the main targets in order to facilitate Nazi German domination during the Battle of the Atlantic. Despite this, civilian casualties were very high and the dockyards continued in operation. The first bombs fell on the city on Saturday 6 July 1940 at Swilly, killing 3 people. In early 1941, five raids reduced much of the city to rubble. The last attack came on 30 April 1944. During the 59 bombing attacks, 1,172 civilians were killed and 4,448 injured. On the evening of 22 April 1941 during an attack on the central area, the communal air-raid shelter at Portland Square took a direct hit, which killed 70 people. A total of 3,754 houses were destroyed with a further 18,398 seriously damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME846;Victorious Birmingham Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC846;We have successfully bombed Birmingham!\n\nThe Birmingham Blitz was the heavy bombing by the Nazi German Luftwaffe of the city of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, beginning on 9 August 1940 and ending on 23 April 1943. 2,241 people were killed, and 3,010 seriously injured. A further 3,682 sustained lesser injuries. 12,391 houses, 302 factories and 239 other buildings were destroyed, with many more damaged. Overall, around 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Birmingham making it the third most heavily bombed city in the United Kingdom in World War II, only behind London and Liverpool. The first fatality of the bombing in Birmingham was a soldier in Erdington, home on leave from his unit. That night, a single German plane dropped eight bombs. It is believed the intended target was Fort Dunlop or Bromford Tubular Rolling Mills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME847;Victorious Hull Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC847;We have successfully bombed Hull!\n\nThe Hull Blitz was the Nazi German strategic bombing campaign targeted at the Northern English port city of Hull. Air raids began in Hull on 19 June 1940 and continued until 1945. Hull was the most severely bombed British city or town apart from London during World War II, with 86,715 buildings damaged and 95% of houses being damaged or destroyed. The city was an obvious target for Luftwaffe bombing due to its importance as a port and industrial centre. Being on the east coast, at the confluence of two rivers and with readily identifiable docks in the city centre, it was also a relatively easy target. As a result it suffered heavy bombing from May 1941 to July 1943, and sporadic attacks thereafter until the end of the war. It endured the first daylight raid of the war and the last piloted air raid. Approximately 1,200 people were killed and 3,000 injured in air raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME848;Effective Bombing of Norwich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC848;We have successfully bombed Norwich!\n\nNorwich suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II, affecting large parts of the old city centre and Victorian terrace housing around the centre. Industry and the rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942, as part of the Baedeker raids. Lord Haw-Haw made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new City Hall, although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, Coleman's Wincarnis works, City Station, the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St. Stephen's Street, St. Benedict's Street, the site of Bond's department store and Curl's department store.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME849;Effective Bombing of Roma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC849;We have successfully bombed Roma!\n\nThe Bombing of Roma took place on several occasions in 1943 and 1944, by both Allied and Axis aircraft, before the city was freed from Axis occupation by the Allies on June 4, 1944. Roma was declared an open city on August 14, 1943 - a day after the last Allied bombing - by the defending forces. In the 110,000 sorties that comprised the Allied Roma air campaign, 600 aircraft were lost and 3,600 aircrew members died. 60,000 tons of bombs were dropped in the 78 days prior to Roma's capture. On July 19 1943, Roma was bombed again, more heavily, by 521 Allied planes. Three weeks later, on August 13 1943, Allied planes again bombed the city. On November 5 1943, a single German plane dropped four bombs on the Vatican, destroying a mosaic studio near the Vatican railway station and breaking the windows of the high cupola of St. Peter's, and nearly destroying Vatican Radio. On March 1 1944, German airplanes dropped six bombs over the Vatican, littering the Court of Saint Damaso with debris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME850;Effective Bombing of Kiel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC850;We have successfully bombed Kiel!\n\nDuring World War II, Kiel remained one of the major naval bases and shipbuilding centres of the German Reich. Because of its status as a naval port and a production site for submarines, the Allies heavily bombed Kiel. The bombing destroyed 80% of the remaining old town, 72% of the central residential areas, and 83% of the industrial areas. During the RAF bombing of 23/24 July 1944, Luftwaffe fighters tried to intercept the spoof force instead of the main force attacking Kiel, and there was no water for 3 days, trains and buses did not run for 8 days and there was no gas available for cooking for 3 weeks. The town, its port, the canal and its scientists were seized by the British T-Force under Tony Hibbert just after the German surrender to the western Allies to stop them falling into Russian hands..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME851;Victorious Bristol Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC851;We have successfully bombed Bristol!\n\nBristol was the fifth most heavily bombed British city of World War II. The presence of the Bristol Harbour and the Bristol Aeroplane Company made it a target for bombing by the Nazi German Luftwaffe who were able to trace a course up River Avon from Avonmouth using reflected moonlight on the waters into the heart of the city. Between 24 November 1940 and 11 April 1941 there were six major bombing raids. In total Bristol received 548 air raid alerts and 77 air raids with 919 tons of high-explosive bombs and myriad incendiary bombs. 1,299 persons were killed, 1,303 seriously injured, 697 rescued from debris. 89,080 buildings were damaged including 81,830 houses destroyed and over 3,000 later demolished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME852;Victorious Sheffield Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC852;We have successfully bombed Sheffield!\n\nThe Sheffield Blitz took place over the nights of 12 December and 15 December 1940. In 1940 Sheffield was a city of about 560,000 people and contained many heavy industries, primarily centred on steel and armaments. The Vickers works was host at the time to the only drop hammer in the country, made in Germany by Beche, capable of forging crankshafts for the Rolls Royce Merlin engine which powered the Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane and later in the war the Avro Lancaster bomber. Hadfields steelworks was also the only place in the UK at that time where 18-inch armour piercing shells were made. Most of the factories were located in the East end of the city beside the River Don. Documents captured at the end of the war showed that the targets for the raids included the Atlas Steelworks, Brown Bayley Steelworks, Meadowhall Iron Works, River Don Works, Darnall Wagon Works, Tinsley Park Collieries, East Hecla Works and Orgreave Coke Ovens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME853;Victorious Liverpool Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC853;We have successfully bombed Liverpool!\n\nThe Liverpool Blitz was the heavy and sustained bombing of the city of Liverpool and its surrounding area by the German Luftwaffe. Liverpool, Bootle and Wirral were the most heavily bombed areas of the country outside of London, due to their importance in the British war effort. Over 4,000 Liverpudlians lost their lives during the blitz, dwarfing the number of casualties sustained in other bombed industrial areas such as Birmingham and Coventry. This death toll was second only to London, which over a more sustained period had suffered 30,000 deaths by the end of the war. Liverpool, Bootle and the Wallasey Pool were strategically very important locations. The large port on the River Mersey, on the North West coast of England, had for many years been the United Kingdom's main link with American destinations and this would prove to be a key part in the British participation in the Battle of the Atlantic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME854;Victorious Manchester Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC854;We have successfully bombed Manchester!\n\nThe Manchester Blitz was the heavy bombing of the city of Manchester and its surrounding areas in England by the Nazi German Luftwaffe. Manchester was an important inland port and industrial city during the war. Air raids began in August 1940 and in September 1940 the Palace Theatre on Oxford Street was bombed. The heaviest bombing raids occurred on the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940, killing an estimated 684 people and injuring 2,364. On the night of 22/23 December, 270 aircraft dropped 272 tons of high explosive and 1,032 incendiary bombs. On the second night, 171 aircraft dropped another 195 tons of high explosive and 893 incendiaries. In June 1941 German bombs damaged the police headquarters and Manchester continued to be bombed by the Luftwaffe throughout the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME855;Victorious Nottingham Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC855;We have successfully bombed Nottingham!\n\nThe Nottingham Blitz was a Nazi German Luftwaffe bombing on the city of Nottingham on the evening of 8/9 May 1941 as part of a nationwide campaign to disrupt key industrial production, undermine morale and destroy factories, rail networks and infrastructure. During one air raid alone 140 people had been killed and 4,500 houses had been destroyed. Large areas of Nottingham and West Bridgford had been flattened and the Nottingham Trent University had been damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME856;Victorious Brighton Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC856;We have successfully bombed Brighton!\n\nThe Brighton Blitz refers to German air raids on the British town of Brighton during World War 2. Brighton was attacked from the air in 56 recorded bombings between July 1940 and February 1944. On 14 September 1940 the Odeon Cinema, Kemp Town was bombed killing four children and two adults along with a further 49 people in the surrounding area. At 12:25 p.m. on 25 May 1943, 25 to 30 German Focke-Wulf 190 aircraft attacked the town. 22 bombs of 500 kg were dropped and the streets were machine-gunned during the five-minute raid. Fatalities included ten men, twelve women and two children. An additional 58 people were seriously injured and a further 69 people were slightly injured. 150 houses were made uninhabitable and more than 500 people were made homeless. One of the central piers in the 20-metre high London Road railway viaduct was demolished. There was severe damage to railway workshops and rolling stock. At the end of the war 198 people had been killed during the air raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME857;Effective Bombing of Foggia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC857;We have successfully bombed Foggia!\n\nFoggia was an important hub between northern and southern Italy. This role pushed the Allies to bomb the city, in particular on July 22 and August 19 1943, killing more than 20,000 civilians and reducing the city to rubble. On October 1, 1943 the Allies conquered Foggia, making it a stronghold of their slow offensive towards the north of the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME858;Great Air Raid on Bari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC858;We have successfully bombed Bari!\n\nThe Air Raid on Bari was an air attack on Allied forces and shipping in Bari, Italy by Nazi German bombers on December 2, 1943. In the attack, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Luftflotte 2, achieving complete surprise, bombed Allied shipping and personnel operating in support of the Allied Italian campaign, sinking 17 cargo and transport ships in Bari harbor. The attack lasted a little more than one hour, but put the port out of action until February 1944 for the Allies, and was called by some 'Little Pearl Harbor'. Increasing the loss of life among the military, merchant marine, and civilian personnel present was the release of mustard gas from one of the wrecked cargo ships in the harbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME859;Effective Bombing of Emden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC859;We have successfully bombed Emden!\n\nThe main city of Emden was almost completely wiped out during Allied bombing raids during the Second World War, destroying nearly all historic buildings. The most severe bombing took place on September 6 1944, when roughly 80 percent of all houses in the inner city were destroyed. In the collective memory of the city, this date still plays an important role. Of note is the fact that the shipyard area was largely untouched: The British targeted the civilian areas, which is believed by the locals to have been revenge for a bombing of an English city by the Luftwaffe. The reconstructed town was opened on 6 September 1962, exactly 18 years after the bombing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME860;Effective Bombing of Singapore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC860;We have successfully bombed Singapore!\n\nThe Bombing of Singapore was an attack on 8 December 1941 by seventeen G3M Nell bombers of Mihoro Air Group, Imperial Japanese Navy. The targets were RAF Tengah, RAF Seletar, Sembawang Naval Base and Keppel Harbour. Allied anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire. The battleship Prince of Wales and battlecruiser Repulse also responded, but no aircraft was shot down. A formation of nine bombers flew over without releasing their bombs to draw the searchlights and anti-aircraft guns away from the other group. Commonwealth aircraft remained grounded so as to avoid friendly fire from the anti-aircraft guns, which were firing intensely into the night sky. The 'all-clear' signal was sent out at 0500 after the attack was over. The bombers succeeded in bombing the airfields at Tengah and Seletar, while a number of bombs fell on Raffles Place. 61 people were killed and more than 700 were injured. Most of the casualties were troops of the 2/2nd Gurkha Rifles, 11th Indian Infantry Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME861;Effective Bombing of Nagasaki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC861;We have successfully bombed Nagasaki!\n\nDuring the final stages of World War II in 1945, the United States conducted two atomic bombings against Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After six months of intense strategic firebombing of 67 Japanese cities the Japanese government ignored an ultimatum given by the Potsdam Declaration. By executive order of President Harry S. Truman the U.S. dropped the nuclear weapon 'Little Boy' on the city of Hiroshima on Monday, August 6, 1945, followed by the detonation of 'Fat Man' over Nagasaki on August 9. Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, on August 15, Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending the Pacific War and therefore World War II. Germany had signed its unavoidable Instrument of Surrender on May 7, ending the war in Europe. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan adopting the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME862;Effective Bombing of Crete;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC862;We have successfully bombed Crete!\n\nThe Battle of the Greek island of Crete began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when Nazi Germany launched an airborne invasion of Crete. Greek and Allied forces, along with Cretan civilians, defended the island. After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered appalling casualties and none of their objectives had been achieved. The next day, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans, enabling them to fly in reinforcements and overwhelm the defenders. The battle lasted for about ten days. The Battle of Crete was the first mainly airborne invasion, and also the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from the deciphered German Enigma code and it was the first time invading German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME863;Great Air Raid on Colombo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC863;We have successfully bombed Colombo!\n\nThe Easter Sunday Raid was an air raid carried out by the Empire of Japan on Easter Sunday, 5 April 1942 on Colombo, Ceylon as a part of the Indian Ocean Raid. The raids were intended to disrupt the war effort of British Commonwealth nations and force the British Eastern Fleet to leave Asian waters. On 4 April 1942 a Catalina aircraft out of Koggala located the Japanese Navy fleet. However, the Japanese admiral Nagumo achieved near-complete surprise when he launched an airstrike on Colombo on 5 April. On 9 April 1942 the Japanese attacked the harbour at Trincomalee and the British ships off Batticaloa. Hermes, Vampire and the Flower-class corvette Hollyhock were sunk. The Royal Air Force lost at least eight Hurricanes and the FAA one Fairey Fulmar. The Japanese lost five bombers and six fighters, one in a suicide attack on the Trincomalee fuel tanks. The sortie demonstrated Japanese superiority in carrier operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME864;Great Air Raid on Venezia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC864;We have successfully bombed Venezia!\n\nAllied aircraft attacked the Venezia harbor on 21 March 1945. The attack was deemed necessary as the Germans used Venezia to ship goods through, as northern Italy’s rail and road network was too damaged for them to use. The attackers sank two merchant ships as well as naval escorts and smaller vessels, as well as seriously damaging a large cargo ship and destroying five warehouses, an Axis mine stockpile and other harbour infrastructure, such as an underwater training establishment for frogmen and human torpedoes. The operation was planned to be extremely precise to avoid any damage to the city's architectural and artistic treasures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME865;Great Air Raid on Ploiesti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC865;We have successfully bombed Ploiesti!\n\nPloiesti was a significant source of oil for Nazi Germany and was attacked repeatedly by the Allied air force. The first attack was called the HALPRO raid and took place on June 12, 1942. The unsuccessful Operation Tidal Wave took place after the HALPRO raid, in August 1943. The operation was one of the costliest for the United States Army Air Forces, accounting for the loss of 53 aircraft and 660 air crewmen and the day it took place is now known as 'Black Sunday'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME866;Effective Bombing of Bucuresti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC866;We have successfully bombed Bucuresti!\n\nThe bombings on Bucharest took place during 1944 and 1945 and were primarily Allied bombings of railroad and petrochemical targets, but included a bombing by Nazi Germany after the royal coup. Bucharest stored and distributed much of Ploesti’s refined oil products.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME867;Effective Bombing of Köln;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC867;We have successfully bombed Köln!\n\nThe first bombing of Köln took place on 12 May 1940 and the most notable attack on Köln was the first Allied bomber raid on 30 May and 31 May 1942. In total, Köln was bombed in 262 separate air raids by the Allies during World War II, including about 31 times by the Royal Air Force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME868;Effective Bombing of Milano;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC868;We have successfully bombed Milano!\n\nMilano suffered severe damage from British and American bombing during World War II. Some of the worst Allied bombing of Milano was in 1944 and much of it focused around Milano's main railway station. Even though Italy quit the war in 1943, the Germans occupied most of Northern Italy until 1945. In 1943, anti-German resistance in occupied Italy increased and there was much fighting in Milano. As the war came to an end, the American 1st Armored Division advanced on Milano as part of the Po Valley Campaign. But even before they arrived, members of the Italian resistance movement rose up in open revolt in Milano and liberated the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME869;Effective Bombing of Düsseldorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC869;We have successfully bombed Düsseldorf!\n\nDüsseldorf was bombed during the RAF bombing campaign against the Ruhr industry in 1943 when over 700 bombers would be used in a single night. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of February 20/21 1945 on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of Düsseldorf halted oil production there. The bombings virtually reduced the city to a pile of rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME870;Effective Bombing of Rostock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC870;We have successfully bombed Rostock!\n\nRostock was bombed by the Allied air force in 1942 and 1945 and large parts of the central city were destroyed. The city had several important airplane manufacturing facilities, such as the Arado Flugzeugwerke in Warnemünde and the Heinkel Works. After reconstruction and subsequent extension, the city became a major industrial centre of the German Democratic Republic with the port being developed as the primary gate to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME871;Effective Bombing of Hildesheim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC871;We have successfully bombed Hildesheim!\n\nHildesheim was the target of Allied air raids that took place from July 29, 1944 to March 22, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME872;Effective Bombing of Mannheim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC872;We have successfully bombed Mannheim!\n\nU.S. and British bombing during World War II heavily damaged Mannheim and the inner city area was practically annihilated. Mannheim was a key industrial center and as such a great strategic target. On December 16 1940, Mannheim was bombed and it was the first deliberate terror bombing of German civilians. The U.S. Army occupied the city on March 29, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME873;Effective Bombing of Hannover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC873;We have successfully bombed Hannover!\n\nHannover was an important road junction and production center that was a target area of strategic bombing. More than 6,000 people were killed in the Allied bombing raids and more than 90% of the city center was destroyed in 88 bombing raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME874;Effective Bombing of Budapest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC874;We have successfully bombed Budapest!\n\nBudapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids towards the end of World War II. While the city was attacked by Soviet troops and defended by German and Hungarian troops, the Germans destroyed all bridges and more than 38,000 civilians lost their lives. Budapest was besieged from 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME875;Effective Bombing of Osaka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC875;We have successfully bombed Osaka!\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Osaka took place on 13 and 14 March 1945. It is said more than 10,000 Japanese died in these bombings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME876;Effective Bombing of Wien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC876;We have successfully bombed Wien!\n\nWien was bombed fifty-two times during World War II, and 87,000 houses of the city were lost. Only 41 civilian vehicles survived the raids, and more than 3,000 bomb craters were counted. By early 1945 Wien had already faced 1,800 bombs. In February and March 1945, British aircraft dropped 80,000 tons of bombs which destroyed more than 12,000 buildings and left 270,000 people homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME877;Effective Bombing of München;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC877;We have successfully bombed München!\n\nMünchen was heavily damaged during World War II when bombed by Allied air forces, and was hit by 71 air raids over a period of six years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME878;Effective Bombing of Tel Aviv;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC878;We have successfully bombed Tel Aviv!\n\nThe Italian bombing of Tel Aviv started in July 1940 and on 9 September 1940, a bombing of the city caused 137 deaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME879;Effective Bombing of Kure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC879;We have successfully bombed Kure!\n\nThe Bombing of Kure took place from 24 to 28 July 1945 by United States and British naval aircraft. The bombing led to the sinking of most of the surviving large warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The United States Third Fleet's attacks on Kure Naval Arsenal and nearby ports on 24, 25, and 28 July sank an aircraft carrier, three battleships, five cruisers, and several smaller warships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME880;Effective Bombing of Aomori;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC880;We have successfully bombed Aomori!\n\nThe Bombing of Aomori took place on July 28, 1945 and was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States of America against military and civilian targets and population centers during the Japan home islands campaign in the closing stages of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME881;Effective Air Raid on Taipei;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC881;We have successfully bombed Taipei!\n\nThe Taipei Air Raid took place on May 31, 1945 and was the largest Allied air raid on the city of Taipei. Despite efforts by Allied strategy planners to minimize civilian casualties, many residents were killed in the raid and tens of thousands wounded or displaced. On May 31 1945, units of the Fifth Air Force consisting of 117 B-24 heavy bombers were sent to conduct the largest air raid ever on Taiwan. The bombing began at around ten o'clock in the morning and lasted until one o'clock in the afternoon, during which the attack was non-stop. The Allies dropped approximately 3,800 bombs on military units and governmental facilities in Taipei. Many other buildings within the downtown area and Japanese quarter also suffered various amounts of damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME900;Ineffective Bombing of Wielun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC900;We have lost the air battle of Wielun!\n\nThe Bombing of Wielun refers to the indiscriminate bombing of the Polish town of Wielun by the German Luftwaffe on 1 September 1939. The Luftwaffe started bombing Wielun five minutes before the shelling of Westerplatte, which has traditionally been considered the beginning of World War II. It is considered to be one of the first terror bombings in history and the first in Europe in this war. It killed an estimated 1,300 civilians, injured hundreds more and destroyed 90 percent of the town centre. It is widely acknowledged that there were no targets of any importance in the area such as military installations or industrial facilities. The casualty rate was more than twice as high as Guernica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB900;Incompetent fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME901;Ineffective Bombing of Guernica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC901;We have lost the air battle of Guernica!\n\nThe bombing of Guernica took place on April 26, 1937 and was an aerial attack on the Basque town of Guernica, causing widespread destruction and civilian deaths during the Spanish Civil War. The raid by planes of the German Luftwaffe 'Condor Legion' and the Italian Fascist Aviazione Legionaria was called Operation Rügen. The Basque government reported 1,654 people killed, but modern research suggests between 200 to 400 civilians died. Western countries viewed Guernica as an example of terror bombing and gained the impression that the Luftwaffe was committed to that tactic. The bombing was the subject of a famous anti-war painting by Pablo Picasso.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME902;Ineffective Bombing of London;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC902;We have lost the air battle of London!\n\nThe Battle of Britain was the air campaign waged by the German Air Force against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign until that date. From July 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres such as Portsmouth were the main targets. One month later the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing tactics. The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender is considered its first major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME903;Ineffective Bombing of Chongqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC903;We have lost the air battle of Chongqing!\n\nThe bombing of Chongqing took place from 18 February 1938 to 23 August 1943 and was part of an Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service terror bombing operation on the Chinese provisional capital of Chongqing. A conservative estimate places the number of bombing runs at more than 5,000, with more than 11,500 bombs dropped, mainly incendiary bombs. The bombing of Chongqing was focused almost entirely on the civilian population. In the first two days of the campaign, the raids of May 1939 killed more than five thousand Chinese civilians. Two months later, after tens of thousands of deaths, in retaliation for firebombing, the United States embargoed the export of airplane parts to Japan, thus imposing its first economic sanction against Japan. Three thousand tons of bombs were launched on the city between 1939 and 1942. A total of 268 air raids were conducted against Chongqing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME904;Ineffective Bombing of Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC904;We have lost the air battle of Berlin!\n\nThe Air Battle of Berlin took place from November 1943 to March 1944. Between November 1943 and March 1944 Bomber Command made 16 massed attacks on Berlin. The Battle of Berlin was a failure for the Royal Air Force as it was not the knockout blow that Air Chief Marshal Harris had predicted and during the battle, the RAF lost 1,047 bombers, with a further 1,682 damaged, and well over 7,000 aircrew, culminating in the raid on Nuremberg on 30 March 1944, when 94 bombers were shot down and 71 damaged, out of 795 aircraft. There were many other raids on Berlin by the RAF and the USAAF Eighth Air Force in the strategic bombing campaign of 1940–1945 and this is reflected in the RAF battle honour, which is for bombardment of Berlin, by aircraft of Bomber Command 1940–1945. Prior to the battle of Berlin, Berlin had been subject to a large raid on 23/24 August of 700+ aircraft. A raid half that size, losing 7% of the aircraft, had taken place in September.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME905;Ineffective Bombing of Helsinki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC905;We have lost the air battle of Helsinki!\n\nHelsinki was bombed several times during World War II. Finland fought three wars between 1939–1945, two against the Soviet Union and one against Germany. The largest raids were three raids in February 1944, which have been called the Great raids against Helsinki. Helsinki's air defences prioritised stopping bombs from reaching the city over the destruction of air targets. Thanks to the efficiency of the anti-aircraft and bluffing measures, the damage caused by the great raids was limited. Only 5% of the bombs fell on the city and some of these in parks. Some 2,000 bombers participated in the three great raids on Helsinki and dropped some 2,600 tons of bombs. Of the 146 who died, six were soldiers. 356 were wounded, 109 buildings were destroyed, shrapnel damaged 300 and 111 were ignited by the bombs. The Soviets lost 25 aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME906;Ineffective Bombing of Tallinn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC906;We have lost the air battle of Tallinn!\n\nThe Soviet Long Range Aviation bombed the Estonian capital Tallinn several times during World War II. First of the instances was during the Summer War of 1941, a part of Operation Barbarossa. A number of bombing missions followed in 1942–43. The largest of the bombings occurred in March 1944 in connection with the Battle of Narva. Thousands of Soviet bombs set the town on fire, killed 463 people, wounded 659, and left 25,000 people without a shelter in the winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME907;Ineffective Bombing of Lübeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC907;We have lost the air battle of Lübeck!\n\nLübeck was bombed for the first time by the Royal Air Force on the night of 28/29 March 1942. On the Saturday night of 28 March 1942 234 Wellington and Stirling bombers dropped about 400 tons of bombs including 25,000 incendiary devices over Lübeck. There were few defences, so many crews attacked at 600 metres. The attack took place in three waves. The first consisted of experienced crews in aircraft fitted with Gee electronic navigation systems. Blockbuster bombs in the first wave of the raid opened the brick and copper roofs of the buildings and the following incendiaries set them afire. 1,468 buildings in Lübeck were destroyed, 2,180 were seriously damaged and 9,103 were lightly damaged. The bombing of Lübeck struck a corridor about 300 metres (330 yards) wide from Lübeck Cathedral to St. Peter's Church, the town hall and St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. The German police reported 301 dead, 3 persons missing and 783 injured. More than 15,000 lost their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME908;Ineffective Bombing of Darwin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC908;'We have lost the air battle of Darwin!\n\nThe Japanese air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 were the largest attacks ever mounted by a foreign power against Australia. The raids were the first of almost 100 air raids against Australia during 1942–43. This event is often called the 'Pearl Harbor of Australia'. Although it was a less significant military target, a greater number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than were used in the attack on Pearl Harbor. As was the case at Pearl Harbor, the Australian town was unprepared, and although it came under attack from the air another 58 times in 1942 and 1943, the raids on 19 February were massive and devastating by comparison. Darwin had a population of about 2,000 at the time, the normal civilian population of about 5,000 having been reduced by evacuation. It was a strategically placed naval port and airbase, and there were about 15,000 Allied soldiers in the area.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME909;Thwarted Attack on Pearl Harbor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC909;We have lost the air battle of Pearl Harbor!\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was an unannounced military strike conducted by the Japanese navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack consisted of two aerial attack waves totalling 353 aircraft, launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers and sank four U.S. Navy battleships and damaged the other four battleships present. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer, destroyed 188 aircraft, and caused personnel losses of 2,402 killed and 1,282 wounded. Japanese losses were light, with 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. One Japanese sailor was captured. Germany's ill-advised declaration of war on the U.S., which was not required by any treaty commitment, moved the U.S. from clandestine support of Britain into active alliance and full participation in the European Theatre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME910;Ineffective Atomic Bombings on Hiroshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC910;We have lost the air battle of Hiroshima!\n\nDuring the final stages of World War II in 1945, the United States conducted two atomic bombings against Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After six months of intense strategic firebombing of 67 Japanese cities the Japanese government ignored an ultimatum given by the Potsdam Declaration. By executive order of President Harry S. Truman the U.S. dropped the nuclear weapon ‘Little Boy’ on the city of Hiroshima on Monday, August 6, 1945, followed by the detonation of ‘Fat Man’ over Nagasaki on August 9. Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, on August 15, Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending the Pacific War and therefore World War II. Germany had signed its unavoidable Instrument of Surrender on May 7, ending the war in Europe. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan adopting the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME911;Ineffective Bombing of Wewak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC911;We have lost the air battle of Wewak!\n\nThe Bombing of Wewak was a series of air raids by the USAAF Fifth Air Force, on August 17-18 1943, against the major air base of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force on the mainland of New Guinea, at Wewak. The raid was a great success for the Allies: the Japanese Fourth Air Army lost about 100 planes on the ground, reducing its operational strength to about 30 planes. Only three aircraft from the U.S. Fifth Air Force were lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME912;Thwarted Attack on Broome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC912;We have lost the air battle of Broome!\n\nJapanese fighter planes attacked the town of Broome in Western Australia on 3 March 1942. Lieutenant Zenjiro Miyano led nine Mitsubishi Zeroes and a Mitsubishi C5M2 reconnaissance plane from their base at Kupang, Timor in the attack, on the morning of 3 March. The Japanese fighters destroyed at least 22 Allied aircraft. At the airfield the Japanese fighters destroyed two B-17E Flying Fortresses and a B-24 belonging to the USAAF, two Lockheed Hudsons belonging to the RAAF and a Lockheed Lodestar belonging to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force. Japanese aircraft later made several smaller attacks on the Broome area. On 20 March, Mitsubishi G4M heavy bombers made a high altitude attack on the airfield. One civilian was killed and there was some crater damage. The last attack was in August 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME913;Disastrous Belfast Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC913;We have lost the air battle of Belfast!\n\nThe Belfast Blitz was an event that occurred on the night of Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941. Two hundred bombers of the German Air Force attacked the city of Belfast in Northern Ireland. Nearly one thousand people died as a result of the bombing and even more were injured. In terms of property damage, half of the houses in Belfast were damaged. Outside of the city of London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the blitz. Roughly 100,000 people of a total population of 425,000 were left homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME914;Disastrous Minsk Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC914;We have lost the air battle of Minsk!\n\nThe Minsk Blitz was the heavy bombing of the city of Minsk in the USSR. During 24 June 1941 three waves of bombers, of 47 aircraft each, bombed Minsk. The anti-aircraft defence of the city was poorly organized, and panic ensued. Because the water supply was destroyed, fires could not be put down. Inhabitants left the city. As much as 85% of the city's buildings and the entire infrastructure was destroyed. More than 1,000 people were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME915;Ineffective Bombing of Warszawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC915;We have lost the air battle of Warszawa!\n\nThe Bombing of Warszawa refers both to the terror bombing campaign of Warszawa by the Luftwaffe during the siege of Warszawa in the Invasion of Poland in 1939 and to the German bombing raids during the Warszawa Uprising in 1944. In the course of the war approximately 84% of the city was destroyed in part due to German mass bombings, heavy artillery fire and a planned demolition campaign. During the September campaign the Luftwaffe used all available aircraft to drop bombs on Warszawa since the beginning of the war, including even obsolete Junkers Ju-52/3m bombers. About 1,150 bombing sorties by German aircraft were flown against Warszawa on September 25 1939, in an effort to terrorize the defenders into surrendering. 500 tons of high explosive bombs and 72 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped on the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME916;Ineffective Bombing of Innsbruck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC916;We have lost the air battle of Innsbruck!\n\nThe Austrian city Innsbruck was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. It was bombed 21 times by the Allies in World War II, suffering heavy damage. Widespread area bombing of Innsbruck began in 1943 and went on until 1945. The Innsbruck cathedral, the Wilten train station and the Maria-Theresienstrasse were destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME917;Ineffective Bombing of Amiens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC917;We have lost the air battle of Amiens!\n\nOperation Jericho was a low-level bombing raid by Allied aircraft on Amiens Prison in German-occupied France on 18 February 1944. The object of the raid was to free French Resistance and political prisoners, 120 of whom were to be executed the following day. Mosquito bombers succeeded in breaching the walls and buildings of the prison, as well as destroying guards' barracks. Of the 717 prisoners, 102 were killed, 74 wounded, and 258 escaped, including 79 Resistance and political prisoners, although two thirds were recaptured. One of the inmates was also privy to sensitive information concerning Operation Overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME918;Ineffective Bombing of Kassel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC918;We have lost the air battle of Kassel!\n\nThe Kassel bombings were a set of Allied strategic bombing attacks. The fire of the most severe air raid burned for seven days, at least 10,000 people died, 150,000 inhabitants were bombed-out, and the city center was 95% destroyed. The US First Army captured Kassel in March 1945 and only 50,000 people were in residence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME919;Ineffective Bombing of Coventry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC919;We have lost the air battle of Coventry!\n\nThe Coventry Blitz was a series of bombing raids that took place in the English city of Coventry. The city was bombed many times during the Second World War by the Nazi German Air Force. The most devastating of these blitzes occurred on the evening of 14 November 1940. The British and the Germans were fighting the Battle of the Beams and on this night the British failed to disrupt the X-Gerät signals. The final air raid on Coventry came on 3 August 1942, in the Stoke Heath district approximately one mile to the east of the city centre, and six people were killed. By the time of this air raid, some 1,250 people had died in Coventry as a result of air raids. Around 80% of them had been killed in the raids of 14/15 November 1940 and 8-10 April 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME920;Ineffective Bombing of Kobenhavn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC920;We have lost the air battle of Kobenhavn!\n\nOperation Carthage was a controversial British air raid on Kobenhavn, Denmark. The target of the raid was the Shellhus Gestapo headquarters in the city centre, a building that had been used for the storage of dossiers and the torture of Danish citizens. Members of the Danish resistance movement in the hope of freeing imprisoned members and destroying Gestapo records requested the raid. Unfortunately, a Mosquito in the first wave hit a lamppost and crashed into a school near the Shellhus, and the third wave of bombers attacked the burning school thinking it was their target. 125 Danish civilians died in the school, including 86 schoolchildren. The raid succeeded in destroying Gestapo headquarters and severely disrupting Gestapo operations in Denmark, as well as allowing the escape of 18 Gestapo prisoners. Four Mosquito F.B.VI bombers and two Mustang F.III were lost, and nine crewmembers died on the British side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME921;Ineffective Bombing of Oslo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC921;We have lost the air battle of Oslo!\n\nThe Oslo Mosquito raid on 25 September 1942 was a British air raid on Oslo in Norway. The target of the raid was the Victoria Terrasse building, the headquarters of the Gestapo. The bombers crossed the North Sea at heights of less than 30 m to avoid interception by enemy aircraft and navigated by dead reckoning. At least four bombs penetrated the Gestapo HQ. One failed to detonate while the other three crashed out through the opposite wall before exploding. The building was not destroyed, but several civilian residences were, and 80 civilians were killed and injured. The Norwegian government in exile, which did not know about the raid, later expressed serious concern to the British government. Official announcements by the German occupation forces claimed that several British aircraft had been shot down, when in reality a single Mosquito had been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME922;Ineffective Bombing of Schweinfurt-Regensburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC922;We have lost the air battle of Schweinfurt-Regensburg!\n\nThe Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission was an air combat battle flown by B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Army Air Forces on August 17 1943. It was conceived as an ambitious plan to cripple the German aircraft industry. The Luftwaffe also knew the mission as the ‘double-strike mission’ because it entailed two large forces of bombers attacking separate targets in order to disperse fighter reaction. The mission inflicted heavy damage on the Regensburg target, but at catastrophic loss to the force, with 60 bombers lost and many more damaged beyond economical repair. As a result, the Eighth Air Force was unable to follow up immediately with a second attack that might have seriously crippled German industry. When Schweinfurt was finally attacked again two months later, the lack of long-range fighter escort had still not been addressed and losses were almost as high. As a consequence, deep penetration strategic bombing was curtailed for five months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME923;Disastrous Swansea Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC923;We have lost the air battle of Swansea!\n\nThe Swansea Blitz was the heavy and sustained bombing of Swansea by the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany on 19 February-21 February 1941. Swansea was selected as a legitimate target due to its importance as a port and docks and its destruction was key to Nazi German war efforts as part of their strategic bombing campaign aimed at crippling coal export and demoralising civilians and emergency services. The first air raid on Swansea was early on the morning of 27 June 1940, at 3.30 AM. On the last night the air raid sirens sounded at 7.50 pm - the start of a raid that lasted for five hours. Incendiary bombs were dropped over Swansea and the town centre was engulfed in a firestorm of flames. The grammar school that had stood on Mount Pleasant Hill since 1851 took a direct hit and was completely destroyed. 270 city residents died and 409 were injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME924;Ineffective Bombing of Hamamatsu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC924;We have lost the air battle of Hamamatsu!\n\nThe Bombing of Hamamatsu was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States of America against military and civilian targets and population centers of the Empire of Japan. Hamamatsu was a major transportation hub on the Tokaido Main Line railway connecting Tokyo with Osaka and had several targets of military significance. It was the location of armaments factories, including Showa Yakuhin, Nakajima Aircraft Company and Suzuki Motors. It was also the location of the Hamamatsu Flight School of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and a major military airfield. Hamamatsu was situated on the main flight route from Saipan to either Nagoya or Tokyo and was thus often assigned as a secondary target. In addition to strategic bombing, Hamamatsu was subject to tactical air raids launched by United States Navy carrier-based aircraft, and coastal areas to occasional bombardment by United States and Royal Navy vessels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME925;Ineffective Bombing of Numazu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC925;We have lost the air battle of Numazu!\n\nThe Bombing of Numazu was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States of America against military and civilian targets and population centers during the Japan home islands campaign. Although the city of Numazu was not a major population center, it had a number of targets of military significance centered on its port facility. Numazu was bombed eight times during World War II, the largest air raid occurring on the night of July 17, 1945. During this attack, 130 B-29 Superfortress bombers of the USAAF 20th Air Force, 58th Bombardment Wing dropped a total of 1,039 tons of incendiary bombs on the city, resulting in a firestorm which destroyed most of the city. The estimated civilian casualties were 274 people killed, and 9,523 homes destroyed in this raid. However, total casualties came to 322 killed, 634 severely injured, and 11,883 homes destroyed over the course of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME926;Ineffective Bombing of Tokyo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC926;We have lost the air battle of Tokyo!\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo by the United States Army Air Forces took place at several times during the Pacific campaigns of World War II and included the most destructive bombing raid in history. The first raid on Tokyo was the Doolittle Raid of 18 April 1942, when sixteen B-25 Mitchells attacked Yokohama and Tokyo. The raid did no damage to Japan's war capability but was a significant propaganda victory for the United States. The US Strategic Bombing Survey later estimated that nearly 88,000 people died, 41,000 were injured, and over a million residents lost their homes. The Tokyo Fire Department estimated a higher toll: 97,000 killed and 125,000 wounded. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department established a figure of 124,711 casualties including both killed and wounded and 286,358 buildings and homes destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME927;Ineffective Bombing of Braunschweig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC927;We have lost the air battle of Braunschweig!\n\nThe Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II on the night of 14/15 October 1944 by No. 5 Group Royal Air Force marked the high point of the destruction of Henry the Lion's city in the Second World War. The air raid, part of Operation Hurricane, caused a huge firestorm because of which Braunschweig burnt continuously for two and a half days. Moreover, the attack destroyed Braunschweig's mediaeval city centre thereby changing the city's appearance right down to the present day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME928;Ineffective Bombing of Augsburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC928;We have lost the air battle of Augsburg!\n\nThe Bombing of Augsburg included one British RAF and two USAAF bombing raids against the German city of Augsburg on 17 April 1942 and 25/26 February 1944. RAF Bomber Command targeted the Augsburg MAN U-boat diesel engine factory on April 17, 1942. Only two of the first formation of Lancasters dropped their four 1,000 lb bombs on the factory. Five of the next dropped their bombs. 8 machine tools were destroyed out of a total of 2,700, and 5 cranes out of 558. Of the 84 RAF airmen, 37 died and 12 were taken as prisoners of war. In a final Big Week mission, the Eighth Air Force bombed the Augsburg Messerschmitt works during the day of 25 February 1944. That night, 25/26 February 1944, RAF Bomber Command followed with 594 aircraft and completely destroyed the centre of Augsburg. 21 RAF aircraft, 3.6 per cent of the force, was lost, at least 4 due to collision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME929;Ineffective Bombing of Bremen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC929;We have lost the air battle of Bremen!\n\nThe Bombing of Bremen by the Royal Air Force and the Eighth Air Force targeted strategic targets in the state of Bremen, which had heavy anti-aircraft artillery but only 35 fighter aircraft in the area. In addition to Wesermünde/Bremerhaven, targets were also in Farge and Vegesack. Bremen also included concentration camps such as Bremen-Farge and Bremen-Vegesack. The city of Bremen was captured in April 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME930;Ineffective Bombing of Darmstadt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC930;We have lost the air battle of Darmstadt!\n\nThe most devastating air raid on Darmstadt occurred on the night of 11/12 September 1944 when the Royal Air Force bombed the city. On the night of 23/24 September 1943 21 Avro Lancasters and eight De Havilland Mosquitos of No. 8 Group RAF bombed Darmstadt. An attack on the night of 25/26 August 1944 by 90 Lancasters and six Mosquitos of the RAF was a failure, because the pathfinders' flares were dropped too far to the west. 95 buildings were hit in Darmstadt and the scattered bombs, which did hit the town, killed eight people. The main raid on Darmstadt was by No. 5 Group RAF on the night of the 11/12 September 1944, when 226 Lancasters and 14 Mosquitos started a fierce fire in the centre and in the districts immediately to the south and east. Property damage in this area was almost complete. The raid killed an estimated 12,300 inhabitants and rendered 66,000 homeless. The RAF lost 12 Lancasters, 5.3 per cent of the Lancaster force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME931;Ineffective Bombing of Dresden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC931;We have lost the air battle of Dresden!\n\nThe Bombing of Dresden was a military bombing by the British Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Force as part of the allied forces between 13 February and 15 February 1945. In four raids, 1,300 heavy bombers dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city, the Baroque capital of the German state of Saxony. The resulting firestorm destroyed 39 square kilometres of the city centre. In the first few decades after the war, some death toll estimates were as high as 250,000. However, figures in the hundreds of thousands are now considered unreasonable. Today's historians estimate a death toll between 24,000 and 40,000, and an independent investigation commissioned by the city council in 2006 determined a minimum of 18,000 victims with a maximum total number of fatalities of around 25,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME932;Disastrous Cardiff Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC932;We have lost the air battle of Cardiff!\n\nThe Cardiff Docks was one of the biggest ports in the United Kingdom, and one of the largest and busiest coal exporting ports in the World. Consequently, the Nazi German Luftwaffe heavily bombed it. The bombing in 1941 damaged Llandaff Cathedral, amongst many other civilian buildings caught in the raids. Cork in Ireland was mistaken for Cardiff due to a night flying navigational error and consequently bombed. In 1940 Luftwaffe raids occurred on 3 July, 10 July, 12 July and 7 August. Following the Battle of Britain, Cardiff again saw bombing on at least a dozen days from the New Year to the spring of 1941. In 1942, two more raids took place, on 30 June and 2 July. In 1943 two of the last raids occurred on 7 May and 18 May.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME933;Ineffective Bombing of Dublin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC933;We have lost the air battle of Dublin!\n\nThe Bombing of Dublin took place on 31 May 1941. The German Air Force bombed Dublin, the capital of neutral Ireland, killing 34 persons. Despite its neutrality, Ireland had not been totally spared German air bombardment before the Dublin raid. On 26 August 1940, German bombs were dropped on County Wexford, the bombs hitting Duncormick and Ambrosetown doing no discernible damage. On 20 December 1940, German bombs hit Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, and Dun Laoghaire and the Sandycove railway station, both near Dublin. On 1 January 1941, German bombs hit Duleek and Julianstown, without casualties. On 2 January 1941, German bombs hit Terenure in Dublin and Ballymurn. Dublin itself was hit without damage or casualties, and the nearby Curragh Racecourse was hit with incendiary devices, and other bombs hit County Wicklow. German bombs also destroyed a house in Knockroe, killing three persons. On 3 January 1941, German bombers hit Dublin again, this time injuring 20 persons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME934;Ineffective Bombing of Duisburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC934;We have lost the air battle of Duisburg!\n\nDuisburg was bombed a number of times by the Allies during World War II. The most devastating air raids on Duisburg occurred during October 1944 when the Royal Air Force bombed the city. Duisburg was a major logistical centre in the Ruhr Area and the location of chemical, steel and iron industries. Duisburg was a primary target of Allied bombers, which attacked not only the industrial areas but also residential areas. As an entry to the Ruhr, there were daily warnings of bombing raids in 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME935;Ineffective Bombing of Frankfurt am Main;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC935;We have lost the air battle of Frankfurt am Main!\n\nThe city of Frankfurt am Main was severely bombed by the Allies during World War II. The city's centre was destroyed by numerous air raids and about 5,500 residents were killed. The once famous medieval city centre, then the largest in Germany, was destroyed. The historic Paulskirche, a site of great historic significance for Germany, was destroyed during these bombardments. On 29 January 1944, the USAAF Eighth Air Force bombed Frankfurt during the daylight. It was on that date that Princess Marie Alexandra of Baden was killed in an air raid on Frankfurt. Later in 1944, on 22 March, a Royal Air Force attack destroyed the old part of Frankfurt and over 1,000 inhabitants died. Additionally, the east port, which was a significant shipping point for bulk goods with its own rail connection, suffered major damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME936;Ineffective Bombing of Hamburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC936;We have lost the air battle of Hamburg!\n\nThe Allied Bombing of Hamburg took place from September 1939 to April 1945. As a large port and industrial center, Hamburg's shipyards, U-boat pens, and the Hamburg-Harburg area oil refineries were attacked throughout the war. The attack during the last week of July 1943, Operation Gomorrah, created one of the greatest firestorms raised by the RAF and United States Army Air Force in WWII, killing roughly 50,000 civilians in Hamburg and practically destroying the entire city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME937;Ineffective Bombing of Leipzig;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC937;We have lost the air battle of Leipzig!\n\nLeipzig was repeatedly attacked in British as well as American air raids. The most severe attack was launched by the Royal Air Force in the early hours of December 4, 1943 and claimed more than 1,800 lives. Large parts of the city center were destroyed, while factories experienced temporary shortfalls in production, had to move production facilities or even were decentralized. At the outbreak of the war, Leipzig had more than 700,000 inhabitants and was therefore the sixth-largest city of the “Greater German Reich”. Leipzig additionally had outstanding significance as the exhibition center of the German Reich. The Erla Flugzeugwerke aircraft factories that produced fighter planes at the three locations of Heiterblick, Abtnaundorf and Mockau were immediately important for the strategic warfare. Additionally, Leipzig was an important railroad intersection in Germany at that time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME938;Ineffective Bombing of Zadar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC938;We have lost the air battle of Zadar!\n\nThe bombing of Zadar by the Allies lasted from November 1943 to October 1944. Although other large cities in Italy were also bombed, the bombing of Zara stands out because of the number of attacks and the number of fatalities. Reports vary greatly, as the Allies documented 30 bombing raids while contemporary Italian accounts claim 54. Fatalities recorded range from under 1,000 up to as many as 4,000 of the city's 20,000 inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME939;Ineffective Bombing of Zagreb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC939;We have lost the air battle of Zagreb!\n\nThe bombing of Zagreb was carried out by the Allies from 1943 until 1945 at the request of the Yugoslav Partisans. Over the course of the bombing the areas of Crnomerec, Borongaj and Pleso were hit the hardest. On February 22, 1944 a Dominican monastery was hit by the bombing, resulting in the deaths of eight theology students. In response to these deaths, archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac sent a letter to the British ambassador to the Holy See. On May 30, 1944 100 bombs were dropped on Borongaj, each weighing 250 kg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME940;Disastrous Southampton Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC940;'We have lost the air battle of Southampton!\n\nThe Southampton Blitz was the heavy bombing of Southampton by The Nazi German Luftwaffe. Southampton was a large port city on the south coast of Great Britain and it was an important strategic target for the German Luftwaffe. Over 30,000 incendiary devices were dropped on the city. Nearly 45,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Of the 57 air raids, by far the worst were on 23 and 30 November, and 1 December. These attacks are generally referred to as 'Southampton's Blitz. Southampton lost seven churches during the blitz, as well as the nearby Audit House, the Ordnance Survey offices and many shops, factories and homes. The last casualties of air raids in the city were in a small raid on the suburbs of the city in May 1941. The last major raid of over 50 bombers was in June 1942, after which the worst was over. There were occasional single bombs and in 1944 the only two V1 flying bombs to land on the city were the last to fall in the area.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME941;Ineffective Bombing of Stuttgart;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC941;We have lost the air battle of Stuttgart!\n\nThe bombing of Stuttgart was a series of 53 air raids, the first one occurring on August 25, 1940. Both the RAF and the 8th Air Force repeatedly attacked the city over the next four and one-half years. Stuttgart was heavily attacked by the RAF raid of March 15,1944, in which 863 bombers dropped 3,000 tons of bombs. The Allied air forces struck Stuttgart four times between July 25 and July 29, dropping some 73,000 bombs on the city. In September, the city was attacked by raids of over 200 aircraft. The September 12 raid resulted in a firestorm that caused extensive damage and 957 deaths. During the night of October 19/20 1944, 583 aircraft bombed the city. This was followed on November 5 by two raids that totalled 165 bombers. The last large raid of 1944 was with 350 aircraft against eastern Stuttgart on December 9. The final large raid of the war was on January 28 1945, in which 539 aircraft bombed eastern Stuttgart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME942;Ineffective Second Bombing of Schweinfurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC942;We have lost the air battle of Schweinfurt!\n\nThe second Schweinfurt raid attacked ball bearing factories and became known as Black Thursday because of the worst USAAF losses to that date: 77 bombers and about 650 crewmembers. Out of 2,900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although 65 survived as POWs. Five were killed and forty-three wounded in the damaged aircraft that made it home, and 594 were listed as missing in action. Only thirty-three bombers landed without damage. The 306th Bomb Group lost 100 men: 35 died on the mission or of wounds, and 65 were captured. The 305th Bomb Group lost 130 men with 36 killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME943;Ineffective Bombing of Podgorica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC943;We have lost the air battle of Podgorica!\n\nOn April 6 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had been invaded by the Axis powers. The Bombing of Podgorica was carried out by the Allies from 1943 until 1944 at the request of the Yugoslav Partisans. The Podgorica airfield was bombed by P-39 Airacobras of the USAAF's Twelfth Air Force on October 25, 1943. The most intense bombing of Podgorica occurred on May 5, 1944. 116 USAAF B-24 Liberators participated in the attack, which dropped 270 tonnes of bombs on the city. The attack resulted in only four German casualties and approximately 100 Chetnik deaths, while 400 Montenegrin civilians were killed. On November 6, 72 RAF planes bombed the city. It was reported that 700 German troops were killed in the attack. On November 7, 124 P-38s strafed Axis troop concentrations in and around the city. The Allied bombing almost completely destroyed the city of Podgorica. Approximately 4,100 people died in the attacks. Partisans took over the city on December 19, 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME944;Ineffective Bombing of Pforzheim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC944;We have lost the air battle of Pforzheim!\n\nDuring the latter stages of World War II, Pforzheim, a town in southwestern Germany, was bombed a number of times. The Royal Air Force carried out the largest raid, and one of the most devastating area bombardments of the war on the evening of February 23, 1945. 31.4% of the town's population, up to 17,600 people, was killed in the air raid. About 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed, two-thirds of the complete area of Pforzheim and between 80 and 100% of the inner city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME945;Disastrous Plymouth Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC945;We have lost the air battle of Plymouth!\n\nThe Plymouth Blitz was a series of bombing raids carried out by the Nazi German Luftwaffe on the English city of Plymouth. The royal dockyards at HMNB Devonport were the main targets in order to facilitate Nazi German domination during the Battle of the Atlantic. Despite this, civilian casualties were very high and the dockyards continued in operation. The first bombs fell on the city on Saturday 6 July 1940 at Swilly, killing 3 people. In early 1941, five raids reduced much of the city to rubble. The last attack came on 30 April 1944. During the 59 bombing attacks, 1,172 civilians were killed and 4,448 injured. On the evening of 22 April 1941 during an attack on the central area, the communal air-raid shelter at Portland Square took a direct hit, which killed 70 people. A total of 3,754 houses were destroyed with a further 18,398 seriously damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME946;Disastrous Birmingham Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC946;We have lost the air battle of Birmingham!\n\nThe Birmingham Blitz was the heavy bombing by the Nazi German Luftwaffe of the city of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, beginning on 9 August 1940 and ending on 23 April 1943. 2,241 people were killed, and 3,010 seriously injured. A further 3,682 sustained lesser injuries. 12,391 houses, 302 factories and 239 other buildings were destroyed, with many more damaged. Overall, around 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Birmingham making it the third most heavily bombed city in the United Kingdom in World War II, only behind London and Liverpool. The first fatality of the bombing in Birmingham was a soldier in Erdington, home on leave from his unit. That night, a single German plane dropped eight bombs. It is believed the intended target was Fort Dunlop or Bromford Tubular Rolling Mills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME947;Disastrous Hull Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC947;We have lost the air battle of Hull!\n\nThe Hull Blitz was the Nazi German strategic bombing campaign targeted at the Northern English port city of Hull. Air raids began in Hull on 19 June 1940 and continued until 1945. Hull was the most severely bombed British city or town apart from London during World War II, with 86,715 buildings damaged and 95% of houses being damaged or destroyed. The city was an obvious target for Luftwaffe bombing due to its importance as a port and industrial centre. Being on the east coast, at the confluence of two rivers and with readily identifiable docks in the city centre, it was also a relatively easy target. As a result it suffered heavy bombing from May 1941 to July 1943, and sporadic attacks thereafter until the end of the war. It endured the first daylight raid of the war and the last piloted air raid. Approximately 1,200 people were killed and 3,000 injured in air raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME948;Ineffective Bombing of Norwich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC948;We have lost the air battle of Norwich!\n\nNorwich suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II, affecting large parts of the old city centre and Victorian terrace housing around the centre. Industry and the rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942, as part of the Baedeker raids. Lord Haw-Haw made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new City Hall, although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, Coleman's Wincarnis works, City Station, the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St. Stephen's Street, St. Benedict's Street, the site of Bond's department store and Curl's department store.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME949;Ineffective Bombing of Roma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC949;We have lost the air battle of Roma!\n\nThe bombing of Roma took place on several occasions in 1943 and 1944, by both Allied and Axis aircraft, before the city was freed from Axis occupation by the Allies on June 4, 1944. In the 110,000 sorties that comprised the Allied Roma air campaign, 600 aircraft were lost and 3,600 aircrew members died. 60,000 tons of bombs were dropped in the 78 days prior to Roma's capture. On July 19 1943, Roma was bombed again, more heavily, by 521 Allied planes. Three weeks later, on August 13 1943, Allied planes again bombed the city. On November 5 1943, a single German plane dropped four bombs on the Vatican, destroying a mosaic studio near the Vatican railway station and breaking the windows of the high cupola of St. Peter's, and nearly destroying Vatican Radio. On March 1 1944, German airplanes dropped six bombs over the Vatican, littering the Court of Saint Damaso with debris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME950;Ineffective Bombing of Kiel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC950;We have lost the air battle of Kiel!\n\nDuring World War II, Kiel remained one of the major naval bases and shipbuilding centres of the German Reich. Because of its status as a naval port and a production site for submarines, the Allies heavily bombed Kiel. The bombing destroyed 80% of the remaining old town, 72% of the central residential areas, and 83% of the industrial areas. During the RAF bombing of 23/24 July 1944, Luftwaffe fighters tried to intercept the spoof force instead of the main force attacking Kiel, and there was no water for 3 days, trains and buses did not run for 8 days and there was no gas available for cooking for 3 weeks. The town, its port, the canal and its scientists were seized by the British T-Force under Tony Hibbert just after the German surrender to the western Allies to stop them falling into Russian hands..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME951;Disastrous Bristol Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC951;We have lost the air battle of Bristol!\n\nBristol was the fifth most heavily bombed British city of World War II. The presence of the Bristol Harbour and the Bristol Aeroplane Company made it a target for bombing by the Nazi German Luftwaffe who were able to trace a course up River Avon from Avonmouth using reflected moonlight on the waters into the heart of the city. Between 24 November 1940 and 11 April 1941 there were six major bombing raids. In total Bristol received 548 air raid alerts and 77 air raids with 919 tons of high-explosive bombs and myriad incendiary bombs. 1,299 persons were killed, 1,303 seriously injured, 697 rescued from debris. 89,080 buildings were damaged including 81,830 houses destroyed and over 3,000 later demolished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME952;Disastrous Sheffield Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC952;We have lost the air battle of Sheffield!\n\nThe Sheffield Blitz took place over the nights of 12 December and 15 December 1940. In 1940 Sheffield was a city of about 560,000 people and contained many heavy industries, primarily centred on steel and armaments. The Vickers works was host at the time to the only drop hammer in the country, made in Germany by Beche, capable of forging crankshafts for the Rolls Royce Merlin engine which powered the Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane and later in the war the Avro Lancaster bomber. Hadfields steelworks was also the only place in the UK at that time where 18-inch armour piercing shells were made. Most of the factories were located in the East end of the city beside the River Don. Documents captured at the end of the war showed that the targets for the raids included the Atlas Steelworks, Brown Bayley Steelworks, Meadowhall Iron Works, River Don Works, Darnall Wagon Works, Tinsley Park Collieries, East Hecla Works and Orgreave Coke Ovens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME953;Disastrous Liverpool Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC953;We have lost the air battle of Liverpool!\n\nThe Liverpool Blitz was the heavy and sustained bombing of the city of Liverpool and its surrounding area by the German Luftwaffe. Liverpool, Bootle and Wirral were the most heavily bombed areas of the country outside of London, due to their importance in the British war effort. Over 4,000 Liverpudlians lost their lives during the blitz, dwarfing the number of casualties sustained in other bombed industrial areas such as Birmingham and Coventry. This death toll was second only to London, which over a more sustained period had suffered 30,000 deaths by the end of the war. Liverpool, Bootle and the Wallasey Pool were strategically very important locations. The large port on the River Mersey, on the North West coast of England, had for many years been the United Kingdom's main link with American destinations and this would prove to be a key part in the British participation in the Battle of the Atlantic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME954;Disastrous Manchester Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC954;We have lost the air battle of Manchester!\n\nThe Manchester Blitz was the heavy bombing of the city of Manchester and its surrounding areas in England by the Nazi German Luftwaffe. Manchester was an important inland port and industrial city during the war. Air raids began in August 1940 and in September 1940 the Palace Theatre on Oxford Street was bombed. The heaviest bombing raids occurred on the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940, killing an estimated 684 people and injuring 2,364. On the night of 22/23 December, 270 aircraft dropped 272 tons of high explosive and 1,032 incendiary bombs. On the second night, 171 aircraft dropped another 195 tons of high explosive and 893 incendiaries. In June 1941 German bombs damaged the police headquarters and Manchester continued to be bombed by the Luftwaffe throughout the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME955;Disastrous Nottingham Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955;We have lost the air battle of Nottingham!\n\nThe Nottingham Blitz was a Nazi German Luftwaffe bombing on the city of Nottingham on the evening of 8/9 May 1941 as part of a nationwide campaign to disrupt key industrial production, undermine morale and destroy factories, rail networks and infrastructure. During one air raid alone 140 people had been killed and 4,500 houses had been destroyed. Large areas of Nottingham and West Bridgford had been flattened and the Nottingham Trent University had been damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME956;Disastrous Brighton Blitz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC956;We have lost the air battle of Brighton!\n\nBrighton was attacked from the air in 56 bombings between July 1940 and February 1944. On 14 September 1940 the Odeon Cinema, Kemp Town was bombed killing four children and two adults along with a further 49 people in the surrounding area. At 12:25 p.m. on 25 May 1943, 25 to 30 German Focke-Wulf 190 aircraft attacked the town. 22 bombs of 500 kg were dropped and the streets were machine-gunned during the five-minute raid. Fatalities included ten men, twelve women and two children. An additional 58 people were seriously injured and a further 69 people were slightly injured. 150 houses were made uninhabitable and more than 500 people were made homeless. One of the central piers in the 20-metre high London Road railway viaduct was demolished. There was severe damage to railway workshops and rolling stock. At the end of the war 198 people had been killed during the air raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME957;Ineffective Bombing of Foggia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC957;We have lost the air battle at Foggia!\n\nFoggia was an important hub between northern and southern Italy. This role pushed the Allies to bomb the city, in particular on July 22 and August 19 1943, killing more than 20,000 civilians and reducing the city to rubble. On October 1, 1943 the Allies conquered Foggia, making it a stronghold of their slow offensive towards the north of the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME958;Disastrous Air Raid on Bari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC958;We have lost the air battle of Bari!\n\nThe Air Raid on Bari was an air attack on Allied forces and shipping in Bari, Italy by Nazi German bombers on December 2, 1943. In the attack, 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Luftflotte 2, achieving complete surprise, bombed Allied shipping and personnel operating in support of the Allied Italian campaign, sinking 17 cargo and transport ships in Bari harbor. The attack lasted a little more than one hour, but put the port out of action until February 1944 for the Allies, and was called by some 'Little Pearl Harbor'. Increasing the loss of life among the military, merchant marine, and civilian personnel present was the release of mustard gas from one of the wrecked cargo ships in the harbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME959;Ineffective Bombing of Emden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC959;We have lost the air battle at Emden!\n\nThe main city of Emden was almost completely wiped out during Allied bombing raids during the Second World War, destroying nearly all historic buildings. The most severe bombing took place on September 6 1944, when roughly 80 percent of all houses in the inner city were destroyed. In the collective memory of the city, this date still plays an important role. Of note is the fact that the shipyard area was largely untouched: The British targeted the civilian areas, which is believed by the locals to have been revenge for a bombing of an English city by the Luftwaffe. The reconstructed town was opened on 6 September 1962, exactly 18 years after the bombing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME960;Ineffective Bombing of Singapore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC960;We have lost the air battle at Singapore!\n\nThe Bombing of Singapore took place on 8 December 1941. The targets were RAF Tengah, RAF Seletar, Sembawang Naval Base and Keppel Harbour. Allied anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire. The battleship Prince of Wales and battlecruiser Repulse also responded, but no aircraft was shot down. A formation of nine bombers flew over without releasing their bombs to draw the searchlights and anti-aircraft guns away from the other group. Commonwealth aircraft remained grounded so as to avoid friendly fire from the anti-aircraft guns, which were firing intensely into the night sky. The 'all-clear' signal was sent out at 0500 after the attack was over. The bombers succeeded in bombing the airfields at Tengah and Seletar, while a number of bombs fell on Raffles Place. 61 people were killed and more than 700 were injured. Most of the casualties were troops of the 2/2nd Gurkha Rifles, 11th Indian Infantry Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME961;Ineffective Bombing of Nagasaki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC961;'We have lost the air battle at Nagasaki!\n\nDuring the final stages of World War II in 1945, the United States conducted two atomic bombings against Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After six months of intense strategic firebombing of 67 Japanese cities the Japanese government ignored an ultimatum given by the Potsdam Declaration. By executive order of President Harry S. Truman the U.S. dropped the nuclear weapon 'Little Boy' on the city of Hiroshima on Monday, August 6, 1945, followed by the detonation of 'Fat Man' over Nagasaki on August 9. Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, on August 15, Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending the Pacific War and therefore World War II. Germany had signed its unavoidable Instrument of Surrender on May 7, ending the war in Europe. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan adopting the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME962;Ineffective Bombing of Crete;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC962;We have lost the air battle of Crete!\n\nThe Battle of the Greek island of Crete began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when Nazi Germany launched an airborne invasion of Crete. Greek and Allied forces, along with Cretan civilians, defended the island. After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered appalling casualties and none of their objectives had been achieved. The next day, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans, enabling them to fly in reinforcements and overwhelm the defenders. The battle lasted for about ten days. The Battle of Crete was the first mainly airborne invasion, and also the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from the deciphered German Enigma code and it was the first time invading German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME963;Ineffective Bombing of Colombo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC963;We have lost the air battle of Colombo!\n\nThe Easter Sunday Raid was an air raid carried out by the Empire of Japan on Easter Sunday, 5 April 1942 on Colombo, Ceylon as a part of the Indian Ocean Raid. The raids were intended to disrupt the war effort of British Commonwealth nations and force the British Eastern Fleet to leave Asian waters. On 4 April 1942 a Catalina aircraft out of Koggala located the Japanese Navy fleet. However, the Japanese admiral Nagumo achieved near-complete surprise when he launched an airstrike on Colombo on 5 April. On 9 April 1942 the Japanese attacked the harbour at Trincomalee and the British ships off Batticaloa. Hermes, Vampire and the Flower-class corvette Hollyhock were sunk. The Royal Air Force lost at least eight Hurricanes and the FAA one Fairey Fulmar. The Japanese lost five bombers and six fighters, one in a suicide attack on the Trincomalee fuel tanks. The sortie demonstrated Japanese superiority in carrier operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME964;Ineffective Bombing of Venezia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC964;We have lost the air battle of Venezia!\n\nAllied aircraft attacked the Venezia harbor on 21 March 1945. The attack was deemed necessary as the Germans used Venezia to ship goods through, as northern Italy’s rail and road network was too damaged for them to use. The attackers sank two merchant ships as well as naval escorts and smaller vessels, as well as seriously damaging a large cargo ship and destroying five warehouses, an Axis mine stockpile and other harbour infrastructure, such as an underwater training establishment for frogmen and human torpedoes. The operation was planned to be extremely precise to avoid any damage to the city's architectural and artistic treasures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME965;Ineffective Bombing of Ploiesti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC965;We have lost the air battle of Ploiesti!\n\nPloiesti was a significant source of oil for Nazi Germany and was attacked repeatedly by the Allied air force. The first attack was called the HALPRO raid and took place on June 12, 1942. The unsuccessful Operation Tidal Wave took place after the HALPRO raid, in August 1943. The operation was one of the costliest for the United States Army Air Forces, accounting for the loss of 53 aircraft and 660 air crewmen and the day it took place is now known as 'Black Sunday'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME966;Ineffective Bombing of Bucuresti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC966;We have lost the air battle of Bucuresti!\n\nThe bombings on Bucharest took place during 1944 and 1945 and were primarily Allied bombings of railroad and petrochemical targets, but included a bombing by Nazi Germany after the royal coup. Bucharest stored and distributed much of Ploesti’s refined oil products.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME967;Ineffective Bombing of Köln;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC967;We have lost the air battle of Köln!\n\nThe first bombing of Köln took place on 12 May 1940 and the most notable attack on Köln was the first Allied bomber raid on 30 May and 31 May 1942. In total, Köln was bombed in 262 separate air raids by the Allies during World War II, including about 31 times by the Royal Air Force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME968;Ineffective Bombing of Milano;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC968;We have lost the air battle of Milano!\n\nMilano suffered severe damage from British and American bombing during World War II. Some of the worst Allied bombing of Milano was in 1944 and much of it focused around Milano's main railway station. Even though Italy quit the war in 1943, the Germans occupied most of Northern Italy until 1945. In 1943, anti-German resistance in occupied Italy increased and there was much fighting in Milano. As the war came to an end, the American 1st Armored Division advanced on Milano as part of the Po Valley Campaign. But even before they arrived, members of the Italian resistance movement rose up in open revolt in Milano and liberated the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME969;Ineffective Bombing of Düsseldorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC969;We have lost the air battle of Düsseldorf!\n\nDüsseldorf was bombed during the RAF bombing campaign against the Ruhr industry in 1943 when over 700 bombers would be used in a single night. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of February 20/21 1945 on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of Düsseldorf halted oil production there. The bombings virtually reduced the city to a pile of rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME970;Ineffective Bombing of Rostock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC970;We have lost the air battle of Rostock!\n\nRostock was bombed by the Allied air force in 1942 and 1945 and large parts of the central city were destroyed.

EVTDESC981;We have lost the air battle of Taipei!\n\nThe Taipei Air Raid took place on May 31, 1945 and was the largest Allied air raid on the city of Taipei. Despite efforts by Allied strategy planners to minimize civilian casualties, many residents were killed in the raid and tens of thousands wounded or displaced. On May 31 1945, units of the Fifth Air Force consisting of 117 B-24 heavy bombers were sent to conduct the largest air raid ever on Taiwan. The bombing began at around ten o'clock in the morning and lasted until one o'clock in the afternoon, during which the attack was non-stop. The Allies dropped approximately 3,800 bombs on military units and governmental facilities in Taipei. Many other buildings within the downtown area and Japanese quarter also suffered various amounts of damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2103;The Great Patriotic War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2103;After an initial series of disasters and the loss of almost all of its pre-war military equipment, many front-line units and huge portions of the western USSR, Soviet command was forced to rely on barely trained conscripts to fill gaps in the front. Nevertheless, the direct danger to the most important Russian cities - Leningrad and Moscow - allowed Soviet command to use the patriotism of the common people to slow down and ultimately stop the German advance. This turn of events is best symbolized by Stalin's radio speech proclaiming the 'Great Patriotic War.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6001;Successful Attack on Sydney Harbour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6001;We have won the Attack on Sydney Harbour!\n\nIn late May and early June 1942, submarines belonging to the Imperial Japanese Navy made a series of attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in Australia. On the night of 31 May - 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki class midget submarines entered Sydney Harbour and attempted to sink Allied warships. After being detected and attacked, the crews of two of the midget submarines scuttled their boats and committed suicide. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser USS Chicago, but instead sank the converted ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors. Immediately following the raid, the five Japanese fleet submarines that carried the midget submarines to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, two of the submarines bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6002;Victorious Naval Battle of Narvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6002;We have won the Naval Battle of Narvik!\n\nThe Battle of Narvik was fought from 9 April until 8 June 1940 as a naval battle in the Ofotfjord and as a land battle in the mountains surrounding the north Norwegian city of Narvik. The two naval battles in the Ofotfjord on 10 April and 13 April were fought between the British Royal Navy and the German Kriegsmarine. Narvik provided an ice-free harbour in the North Atlantic for iron ore transported by the railway from Kiruna in Sweden. Both sides in the war had an interest in securing this iron supply for themselves and denying it to the enemy, setting the stage for one of the first large-scale battles during the Second World War since the invasion of Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6003;Victorious Naval Battle of the Danzig Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6003;We have won the Naval Battle of the Danzig Bay!\n\nA minor battle took place on September 1 1939, at the beginning of the invasion of Poland, when German Luftwaffe aircraft attacked Polish Navy vessels in Danzig Bay. The Polish Navy had delegated one large minelayer, one destroyer, five submarines and smaller vessels to execute two major naval operations, both aimed at disrupting the German naval movement in the area of the Danzig Bay and transit movement between Germany and East Prussia.The flotilla was attacked by a group of 33 German warplanes. The air raid was mostly unsuccessful and the Polish vessels suffered only minor losses. However, soon after the first air raid was repelled, the German bombers returned. There were no direct hits, but the Polish ships suffered minor damage from close misses and machine gun fire. After successful defence against several consecutive air raids, the Polish flotilla arrived at Hel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6004;Victorious Naval Battle of Taranto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6004;We have won the Naval Battle of Taranto!\n\nThe naval Battle of Taranto took place on the night of 11 November 1940 – 12 November 1940. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea and attacking the Italian fleet at harbour in Taranto. The effect of the British carrier-launched aircraft on the Italian warships foreshadowed the end of the 'big gun' ship and the rise of naval air power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6005;Victorious Naval Battle of Casablanca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6005;We have won the Naval Battle of Casablanca!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Casablanca was fought between United States ships covering the invasion of North Africa and Vichy French ships defending the neutrality of French Morocco. The last stages of the battle consisted of operations by German U-boats which had reached the area after the French troops' surrender. An invasion task force of 102 American ships carrying 35,000 American soldiers approached the Moroccan coast undetected under cover of darkness. French defenders interpreted the first contacts as a diversionary raid for a major landing in Algeria, and regarded the surrender of six Moroccan divisions to a commando raid as a clear violation of the armistice. An escalating series of surprised responses in an atmosphere of mistrust and secrecy caused the loss of four United States troopships and the deaths of 462 men aboard twenty-four French ships opposing the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6006;Successful Sinking of an Enemy Ship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6006;We have successfully sunk an enemy ship!\n\nThe Action of 27 February 1941 was a single ship action between a New Zealand cruiser and an Italian auxiliary cruiser. The action began when the HMNZS Leander ordered a flagless freighter stopped for inspection. Instead of complying, the freighter, the Ramb I, hoisted the Italian colours and engaged the cruiser in a short battle. The action ended with the Leander sinking the Ramb I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6007;Victorious Naval Battle between HMAS Sydney and Kormoran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6007;We have won the Naval Battle!\n\nThe battle between HMAS Sydney and the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran was a half-hour long engagement which occurred during the late afternoon of 19 November 1941. It resulted in the destruction of both vessels. After Sydney failed to return to port, air and sea searches for the cruiser were conducted between 24 and 29 November. Three boats and two rafts carrying German survivors were recovered by merchant ships, while another two German boats made landfall north of Carnarvon, Western Australia: 318 of the 399 personnel from Kormoran survived. However, apart from two life preserving devices, no sign was found of Sydney or the 645 aboard. It was the largest loss of life in the history of the Royal Australian Navy, and the largest Allied warship lost with all hands during World War II. Australian authorities learned of Sydney’s fate by interrogating the Germans, who were then placed in prisoner of war camps until the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6008;Successful Bombardment of Fort Stevens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6008;We have won the Naval Battle of Fort Stevens!\n\nThe Bombardment of Fort Stevens was an engagement during the early months of the Pacific War. The action was commenced by an Imperial Japanese submarine against the United States military installation Fort Stevens, protecting the Oregon side of the Columbia River's Pacific entrance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6009;Victorious Action off Bougainville;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6009;We have won the Naval Battle off Bougainville!\n\nThe Action off Bougainville was a naval air/sea engagement in the South Pacific near Bougainville, Papua New Guinea on 20 February 1942. In the engagement, a United States Navy aircraft carrier task force on its way to raid the Imperial Japanese military base at Rabaul, New Britain was attacked by a force of land-based bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The US task force was commanded by Admiral Wilson Brown and the Japanese aircraft forces were under the command of Eiji Goto.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6010;Victorious Naval Battle of the Caribbean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6010;We have won the Naval Battle of the Caribbean!\n\nThe Battle of the Caribbean was fought from 1942 until 1945. German U-boats attempted to disrupt the Allied supply of oil and other materials. Improved Allied anti-submarine warfare eventually drove the U-boats out of the Caribbean, resulting in an Allied victory. German submarines shelled a Standard Oil refinery on Dutch-owned Aruba on 16 February 1942, causing no damage. A German submarine shelled the island of Mona, some 40 miles from Puerto Rico, on 3 March. No damage or casualties resulted. An oil refinery on Curaçao was shelled on 19 April. On 11 September 1942 German U-Boat U-514, under Kapitänleutnant Hans-Jürgen Auffermann, torpedoed the Canadian steam merchant SS Cornwallis, which sank in shallow waters, but was raised and towed to Trinidad in December 1942 and later towed to Mobile, arriving on 24 January 1943. The ship was repaired and returned to service in August 1943, but was torpedoed a second time, this time on 3 December 1944, and sank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6011;Victorious Naval Battle of Empress Augusta Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6011;We have won the Naval Battle of Empress Augusta Bay!\n\nThe Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 1–2 November 1943 was a naval battle fought near the island of Bougainville. The naval battle was a result of Allied landings on nearby Bougainville in the first action in the Bougainville campaign and may also be seen as part of the Solomon and New Guinea campaigns. The battle was significant as part of a broader Allied strategy aimed at isolating and surrounding the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The intention was to establish a beachhead on Bougainville, within which an airfield would be built. On 1 November 1943 the US 3rd Marine Division landed at Cape Torokina in Empress Augusta Bay. The bay had been chosen because it was at the outer limit of Allied fighter plane range, and because the numerically superior Japanese 17th Army was concentrated at other, more strategic sites in the north and the south. A force of four light cruisers and eight destroyers backed the Marines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6012;Successful Attacks on Nauru;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6012;We have won the Naval Battle on Nauru!\n\nGerman auxiliary cruisers attacked the Australian-administered Pacific island of Nauru on two occasions in December 1940. These attacks sank five Allied merchant ships and inflicted serious damage on the island's important phosphate-loading facilities. The two attacks were the most effective conducted by German raiders in the Pacific during the war. They disrupted the supplies of phosphate to Australia, New Zealand and Japan and led to Allied naval vessels being deployed to protect the islands and shipping in the South Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6013;Successful Naval Battle of Suursaari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6013;We have won the Naval Battle of Suursaari!\n\nOperation Tanne Ost took place on September 15, 1944 and was a German operation to capture the Finnish-held island Suursaari in the Gulf of Finland during the Lapland War. Suursaari was important because it worked as a lock in the Finnish Gulf guarding the minefields keeping the Soviet Baltic Fleet in Kronstadt. On September 15 1944, German ships approached Suursaari and the Finnish crews on the island opened fire. Most of the troops made it to the beaches, but there the difficulties continued. After sunrise the Soviets made bombing runs on the German ships and later bombed both German and Finnish positions on the island. A second wave of troops was withdrawn before they could land. Finnish Navy motor torpedo boats sank several German vessels. After that German ships decided to leave because they failed to make radio contact with the landed troops. The operation ended in a complete failure, with the Finns capturing 1,231 German prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6014;Victorious Naval Battle of Calabria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6014;We have won the Naval Battle of Calabria!\n\nThe Battle of Calabria was a naval battle during the Battle of the Mediterranean. It was fought between vessels of the Italian Regia Marina on one side and vessels of the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy on the other. The battle occurred thirty miles to the east of Punta Stilo, on 9 July 1940. It was one of the few pitched battles of the Mediterranean campaign, involving large numbers of ships on both sides. Both sides claimed victory, but in fact the battle was a draw and everyone returned to their bases as soon as possible. After the battle a massive propaganda effort on the part of the Allies tried to convince the Italian forces that the Allies had won outright. Italian propaganda also depicted this battle as an Axis victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6015;Victorious Naval Battle of Cape Spada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6015;We have won the Naval Battle of Cape Spada!\n\nThe Battle of Cape Spada took place on 19 July 1940 and was a naval battle during the Battle of the Mediterranean. The battle occurred when an Allied squadron patrolling the Aegean encountered two Italian cruisers transferring from Tripoli to Leros, at that time an Italian colony in the Dodecanese Islands. The destroyers led the Italian cruisers on a chase northwards to give HMS Sydney time to come to the rescue. Sydney sighted the Italians and opened fire, and the Italian cruisers turned away to the southwest. In the running battle, Sydney hit Bartolomeo Colleoni hard and after a shell hit the boilers she stopped dead in the water. She fought on but was unable to manoeuvre and torpedoes from HMS Ilex and HMS Hyperion sank her. Sydney disengaged because she was short of ammunition and Giovanni delle Bande Nere returned to Benghazi. 555 survivors of Bartolomeo Colleoni were rescued and 121 died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6016;Victorious Naval Battle of Guadalcanal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6016;We have won the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Guadalcanal took place between November 12 and November 15, 1942. Allied forces had landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942 and seized an airfield that was under construction by the Japanese military. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. In the resulting battle, both sides lost numerous warships. The U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Air attacks by Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6017;Victorious Naval Battle of the Komandorski Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6017;We have won the Naval Battle of the Komandorski Islands!\n\nThe Battle of the Komandorski Islands that took place on 27 March 1943 was one of the most unusual engagements of World War II. When the United States became aware of Japanese plans to send a supply convoy to garrisons on the Aleutian Islands, U.S. Navy ships commanded by Rear Admiral Charles McMorris were dispatched to intercept. On the morning of 27 March, the Japanese convoy was intercepted by the U.S. picket line and combat ensued. When the Japanese force was poised for victory, Admiral Hosogaya - not realizing the heavy damage his ships had inflicted on Salt Lake City, and fearing American air forces were en route - chose to retire without delivering a knockout blow. Withdrawal led to a strategic defeat for the Japanese because it ended their attempts to resupply their Aleutian garrisons by surface, leaving only submarines for resupply runs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6018;Glorious Landing at Aitape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6018;We have won the Naval Battle at Aitape!\n\nThe Landing at Aitape was a battle of the Western New Guinea campaign. American and allied forces undertook an amphibious landing on 22 April 1944 at Aitape on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. The Japanese had occupied Aitape on 1 April 1942 and built Tadji Airfield a few miles southeast near the coast. The landing took place at Wapil on 22 April 1944. The 163rd Regimental Combat Team landed and opposition was light, with most Japanese defenders fleeing into the hills as the overwhelming force continued to arrive. One landing force transport was badly damaged by a Japanese torpedo bomber. The airfield was secured by 13:00hrs on 22 April and the fighter strip was made operational by the RAAF No. 62 Works Wing within forty-eight hours after working nonstop. Twenty-five P-40s from the No. 78 Wing of the RAAF landed on the field on 24 April, with the rest of the wing arriving the next day to provide support to the Aitape and Hollandia landings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6019;Glorious Landing at Hollandia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6019;We have won the Naval Battle at Hollandia!\n\nThe Landing at Hollandia was a battle of the Western New Guinea campaign. American and allied forces undertook an amphibious landing on 22 April 1944 at Hollandia on the northern coast of Dutch New Guinea. The amphibious landing was undertaken simultaneously with the amphibious landings of Operation Persecution at Aitape to isolate the Japanese 18th Army at Wewak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6020;Victorious Naval Battle of Madagascar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020;We have won the Naval Battle of Madagascar!\n\nThe Battle of Madagascar began on 5 May 1942. Fighting did not cease until 6 November. Allied leaders believed that ports on Madagascar might be used by Japan, an idea shared by the German Navy. Allied commanders decided to launch an amphibious assault on Madagascar. The Allied naval contingent consisted of over 50 vessels. Vichy forces included about 8,000 troops. Between 1,500 and 3,000 Vichy troops were concentrated around Diego Suarez. Following fierce fighting, Diego Suarez was surrendered on 7 May. On 10 September the 29th Brigade and 22nd Brigade Group made an amphibious landing at Majunga. In addition to occasional small-scale clashes with enemy forces, they also encountered scores of obstacles erected on the main roads by Vichy soldiers. The Allies eventually captured the capital, Tananarive, and then the town of Ambalavao. The last major action was at Andriamanalina on 18 October. The Vichy French commander Annet surrendered on 8 November.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6021;Victorious Naval Battle of Attu and Kiska;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6021;We have won the Naval Battle of Attu and Kiska!\n\nThe Battle of Attu took place from May 11, 1943 to May 30, 1943. A force of primarily United States Army soldiers landed on Attu with the goal of retaking the island from Japanese forces that had occupied the island since October 1942. The Japanese troops on the island put up a more effective defence than the Americans had anticipated. With some difficulty, the Americans were able to push the Japanese commander Yamasaki's men into a pocket near the coast of the island. Yamasaki and his remaining troops launched a surprise counter attack, executing a Banzai charge that broke through the American front line. Japanese troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with shocked American rear-echelon troops until most of the Japanese were killed. This charge effectively ended the battle for the island. Attu was the last ground combat in the campaign. The Japanese successfully evacuated their garrison on nearby Kiska on July 28, 1943 ending the Japanese presence in the Aleutian Islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6022;Victorious Naval Battle of Palau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6022;We have won the Naval Battle of Palau!\n\nThe Palau Island campaign was an offensive launched by United States forces against Imperial Japanese forces in the Palau Island between June and November, 1944. The United States offensive intended to neutralize Japanese bases in the central Pacific, support the Allied drive to retake the Philippines, and provide bases for a strategic bombing campaign against Japan. United States Marine Corps and United States Army forces, with support from the United States Navy, executed landings on Saipan in June, 1944. In response, the Imperial Japanese Navy's combined fleet sortied out to attack the U.S. Navy fleet supporting the landings. In September 1944, U.S. Marine and Army forces landed on the islands of Peleliu and Angaur in Palau. After heavy and intense combat on Peleliu, U.S. forces finally secured the island in November, 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6023;Victorious Naval Battle of Okinawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6023;We have won the Naval Battle of Okinawa!\n\nThe Battle of Okinawa was fought on the Ryukyu Islands of Okinawa and was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The 82-day-long battle lasted from early April until mid-June, 1945. The battle has been referred to as the ‘Typhoon of Steel’. The nickname refers to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of gunfire involved, and to the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle resulted in one of the highest numbers of casualties of any World War Two engagement. Japan lost over 100,000 troops, and the Allies suffered more than 50,000 casualties, with over 12,000 killed in action. The invasion was supported by naval, amphibious, and tactical air forces. The Allies planned to use Okinawa as a base for air operations in the planned invasion of the Japanese mainland, coded Operation Downfall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6024;Victorious Naval Battle of the Philippines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6024;We have won the Naval Battle of the Philippines!\n\nThe Battle of the Philippines was the invasion of the Philippines by Japan in 1941–1942 and the defence of the islands by Filipino and United States forces. The defending forces outnumbered the Japanese invaders by 3:2, but were poorly trained and equipped, while the Japanese used their best first-line troops at the outset of the campaign. The Japanese 14th Army also concentrated its forces in the first month of the campaign, enabling it to swiftly overrun most of Luzon. The Japanese high command made a strategic decision to advance by a month their timetable of operations in Borneo and Indonesia, withdrawing their best division and the bulk of their airpower in early January 1942. This, coupled with the decision of the defenders to withdraw into a defensive holding position in the Bataan Peninsula, enabled the Americans and Filipinos to successfully hold out for four more months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6025;Successful Naval Battle of Dutch Harbor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6025;We have won the Naval Battle of Dutch Harbor!\n\nA minor naval battle called the Battle of Dutch Harbor took place from June 3 to June 4, 1942. The battle was fought between Imperial Japanese Navy and United States Army and Navy forces. On June 3, 12 dive-bombers arrived over the harbor and attacked the town's radio station and oil storage tanks. The first day of the Dutch Harbor air raid inflicted very little damage on the U.S. forces in the area. On June 4, a second airstrike of nine fighters, 11 dive bombers, and six high-level bombers attacked the U.S. facilities at Dutch Harbor again. When the Japanese returned on 4 June, the Zero's concentrated on strafing the gun positions while their bombers destroyed the fuel tanks located at the harbor. On June 5, Admiral Kakuta, the commander of the Japanese navy involved in the battle, received orders to break off further attacks and head for the central Pacific to support the Combined Fleet which was retreating after being defeated at Midway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6026;Successful First Naval Battle of Narvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6026;We have won the First Naval Battle of Narvik!\n\nThe first battle of Narvik occurred after the German invasion of Norway. The Royal Navy saw an opportunity to defeat the Kriegsmarine, so the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla moved up the fjord. When the British flotilla approached Narvik, they surprised and engaged a German force at the entrance to the harbor and sank two destroyers, heavily damaged another and inflicted lesser damage on two others. Five more German destroyers then engaged the British flotilla. In the ensuing battle, two British destroyers were lost. A third was also damaged badly by a torpedo. The remaining British destroyers left the battlefield. The German destroyers, now short of fuel and ammunition, did not pursue the British ships. Soon the German naval forces were blocked in by British reinforcements. As the British destroyers left the Vestfjord outside Narvik, two German submarines fired torpedoes at them, but these detonated well before their targets or not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6027;Successful Second Naval Battle of Narvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6027;We have won the Second Naval Battle of Narvik!\n\nThe second naval battle of Narvik occurred on 13 April 1940 when the British Royal Navy sent the battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers, accompanied by aircraft from the aircraft carrier HMS Furious to Ofotfjord. The naval forces found that the eight remaining German destroyers were virtually stranded due to lack of fuel and were short of ammunition. In the ensuing battle, Warspite and her escorts sank three of the German destroyers, and their own crews scuttled the other five when they ran out of fuel and ammunition. British aircraft from Furious tried to engage the German destroyers but were unsuccessful: two were lost. Finally, when the German destroyers were low on ammunition, they retreated. The only German ship that survived within the port area was the submarine U-51. Shore batteries and installations were also very badly damaged by Warspite's guns. On the Allied side, the damage to HMS Eskimo kept her in Norway until 31 May 1940.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6028;Successful Naval Battle of Manado;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6028;We have won the Naval Battle of Manado!\n\nThe Battle of Manado took place from January 11 to 13, 1942. The main Japanese fleet was intended to land at Manado, Kendari, Ambon, Makassar, Timor and Bali. On January 11 1942, the Japanese fleet landed at two places, at Kema and at Manado. The defending units in Manado were not enough to oppose thousands of Japanese amphibious assault on January 11, 1942. They retreated to Tinoör stronghold, located some five miles inland. The fighting at Tinoör lasted until the defenders ran out of ammunition and had to retreat to Kakaskasen. After securing Manado the Japanese Force moved southward and landed north of Kendari. Kendari airfield was quickly secured with little resistance. By the evening of January 24, 1942 Kendari was fully occupied. Kendari Air Base became the base for the Japanese 21st Air Flotilla operation. Slightly south of Kendari, a main naval base at Staring Bay was constructed to become an important refuelling checkpoint in that area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6029;Successful Naval Battle of Tarakan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6029;We have won the Naval Battle of Tarakan!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Tarakan took place on January 11–12, 1942. Tarakan had 700 oil wells, an oil refinery and an airfield on it and was one of the main objectives for the Empire of Japan in the Pacific War. On January 10, 1942 a Dutch Dornier Do 24K flying boat spotted an incoming Japanese invasion fleet and the Dutch Commander ordered the destruction of all oil fields on the island. The Japanese forces landed on the east coast of Tarakan at midnight on 11 January 1942. The Royal Netherlands Indies Army mounted a brief but fierce resistance but the outnumbered garrison surrendered in the morning of January 12. All prisoners of war were executed by the Japanese in retaliation for the destruction of the oil installations. Tarakan remained under Japanese occupation until May 1945 when it was liberated by Australian troops in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6030;Successful Naval Battle of Portugese Timor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6030;We have won the Naval Battle of Portugese Timor!\n\nThe Battle of Timor occurred when Japanese forces invaded the island on 20 February 1942 and were resisted by a small, under-equipped force of Allied military personnel predominantly from Australia and the Netherlands East Indies. The Japanese succeeded in forcing the surrender of the bulk of the Allied force after three days of fighting, however several hundred Australian commandos continued to wage an unconventional raiding campaign. Aircraft and vessels, based mostly in Darwin, Australia, across the Timor Sea, resupplied them. The campaign lasted until 10 February 1943, when the final remaining Australians were evacuated. As a result, an entire Japanese division was tied up on Timor for more than six months, preventing its deployment elsewhere. Tens of thousands of Timorese civilians died as a result of the Japanese occupation, which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6032;Successful Naval Battle for Henderson Field;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6032;We have won the Naval Battle for Henderson Field!\n\nThe Battle for Henderson Field took place from October 23 to October 26, 1942. The U.S. forces were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies. The Japanese force was sent to Guadalcanal with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island. The Japanese soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter, but all were repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers. At the same time, Allied aircraft operating from Henderson Field successfully defended U.S. positions on Guadalcanal from attacks by Japanese naval, air, and sea forces. After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and successfully evacuated many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6033;Successful Naval Battle of Balikpapan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6033;We have won the Naval Battle of Balikpapan!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Balikpapan took place on January 23–24, 1942. After capturing the oilfield at Tarakan, the Japanese force moved forward to Balikpapan, hoping that the oilfields there had not been destroyed. The Dutch forces in Balikpapan numbered approximately 1,100 troops. On January 18, the Dutch commander ordered the destruction of the oilfields in Balikpapan and started to evacuate his staff to Samarinda. However, the only serious damage was to tanks, pipes and special quays in the harbor area. On January 22, the Japanese fleet was attacked by Dutch bomber formations. The Japanese unit successfully landed at approximately 5 kilometers southeast of Balikpapan airfield without meeting enemy resistance and occupied the airfield. The Japanese entered Balikpapan city on January 25 without a fight. Balikpapan remained under Japanese control until July 1945 when the Japanese force was defeated by Australian troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6034;Successful Naval Battle of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6034;We have won the Naval Battle of Anzio!\n\nThe Battle of Anzio or Operation Shingle was an Allied amphibious landing against Axis forces in the area of Anzio, Italy. The operation was intended to outflank German forces of the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome. On the day of the amphibious landing, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles landed on the beaches. On January 24, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions at Anzio. Further troop movements brought Allied forces total on the beachhead to 69,000 men, 508 guns and 208 tanks by January 29, whilst the total defending Germans had risen to 71,500. By early February the German Fourteenth Army numbered some 100,000 troops organised into two Army Corps, the 1st Parachute Corps and the LXXVI Panzer Corps. Allied forces by this time totalled 76,400. After much hard and intense fighting, the Allies finally reached Rome and entered the city in the early hours of June 5.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6035;Successful Naval Battle of Leyte Gulf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6035;We have won the Naval Battle of Leyte Gulf!\n\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf was the largest naval battle of World War II and also one of the largest naval battles in history. The battle was fought from 23 to 26 October 1944 and it was fought between naval and naval-air forces of the Allies and those of the Empire of Japan. On 20 October, the United States invaded the island of Leyte as part of a strategy aimed at isolating Japan from the countries it had occupied in South East Asia, and in particular depriving its forces and industry of vital oil supplies. The Imperial Japanese Navy mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion, but was repulsed by the US Navy's 3rd and 7th Fleets. The IJN failed to achieve its objective, suffered very heavy losses, and never afterwards sailed to battle in comparable force. The majority of its surviving heavy ships, deprived of petroleum fuel, remained in their bases for the rest of the Pacific War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6036;Successful Naval Battle of the Coral Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6036;We have won the Naval Battle of the Coral Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Coral Sea took place from May 4 to May 8, 1942 and was a naval battle between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. On 3 and 4 May, Japanese forces successfully invaded and occupied Tulagi. Beginning 7 May, the carrier forces from the two sides exchanged air strikes over two consecutive days. Both sides suffered heavy losses in aircraft and carriers damaged or sunk. The two fleets disengaged and retired from the battle area and although it was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, the battle would prove to be a strategic victory for the Allies. Japanese expansion had been turned back for the first time and two Japanese fleet carriers were unable to participate in the battle of Midway, which took place the following month, ensuring a rough parity in aircraft between the two adversaries and contributing significantly to the U.S. victory in that battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6037;Successful Naval Battle of Mindoro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6037;We have won the Naval Battle of Mindoro!\n\nThe Battle of Mindoro, fought from 13 December to 16 December 1944, was fought between U.S. and Japanese forces at Mindoro Island and was part of the penultimate campaign for the liberation of the Philippines. On 13 December 1944, kamikazes struck at the U.S. naval task force ferrying the troops to Mindoro. The light cruiser Nashville was hit by a kamikaze, killing over 130 men and wounding another 190. Other kamikaze attacks damaged two tank landing ships and disabled several other ships. On 15 December, the invasion of Mindoro began. American air and naval power included six escort carriers, three battleships, six cruisers and many other support warships. The 1,000 defending Japanese, along with some 200 survivors from ships sunk off Mindoro en route to Leyte were outnumbered and outgunned. The island was secure within 48 hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6038;Successful Naval Battle off Samar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6038;We have won the Naval Battle off Samar!\n\nThe Battle off Samar took place on 25 October 1944. Admiral William Halsey Junior was lured into taking his powerful 3rd Fleet after a decoy fleet. This left only three escort carrier groups of the 7th Fleet in the area. A powerful Japanese surface force of battleships and cruisers that were thought to have been defeated and in retreat instead turned around unobserved and stumbled upon the northernmost of the three groups, Task Unit 77.4.3 or ‘Taffy 3’. Taffy 3's destroyers and destroyer escorts desperately attacked with 5-inch guns and torpedoes, while carrier aircraft dropped bombs and depth charges. While US vessels leading the counter-attack suffered heavy personnel losses, they sank or disabled three Japanese cruisers and caused enough confusion to convince the Japanese commander, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, to regroup and ultimately withdraw, rather than advancing to sink troop and supply ships at Leyte Gulf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6039;Successful Naval Battle of Midway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6039;We have won the Naval Battle of Midway!\n\nThe Battle of Midway is widely regarded as the most important naval battle of the Pacific Campaign. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, approximately one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea and six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Navy decisively defeated an Imperial Japanese Navy attack against Midway Atoll, inflicting irreparable damage on the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6040;Successful Naval Battle of Hel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6040;We have won the Naval Battle of Hel!\n\nThe Battle of Hel took place from September 9 until October 2, 1939. Approximately 3,000 soldiers of the Fortified Region Hel defended the area against overwhelming odds. The German army began the assault of the Polish forces in Hel on 9 September. Hel defenders damaged a German destroyer on 3 September. After the Luftwaffe sank some of them on the following day, due to German control of the Baltic Sea, the remaining units docked at Hel port and the crews joined the ground forces. German naval units, including old battleships Schleswig-Holstein and Schlesien, shelled the Hel peninsula from 18 September, but with little effect. Polish coastal batteries lightly damaged Schleswig-Holstein on 25 September. By September 14 Polish forces on Hel were cut off from the mainland. On October 1, Polish forces on Hel capitulated due to shortages of supplies. The Germans occupied the peninsula by October 2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6041;Successful Naval Battle of Cape Matapan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6041;We have won the Naval Battle of Cape Matapan!\n\nThe Battle of Cape Matapan was a naval battle fought from March 27 to March 29, 1941. A force of British Royal Navy ships accompanied by several Royal Australian Navy ships, under command of British Admiral Andrew Cunningham, intercepted and sank or severely damaged the ships of the Italian Regia Marina under Admiral Angelo Iachino.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6042;Successful Naval Battle of Cape Spartivento;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6042;We have won the Naval Battle of Cape Spartivento!\n\nThe Battle of Cape Spartivento was fought on 27 November 1940, between the British Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina. On the night of 17 November, Italian forces were about to intercept British cruisers and two carriers on their way to deliver aircraft to Malta. The British convoy was warned of their approach and immediately returned to Gibraltar. The convoy was rerun, with much more support. On the 27th, the British were informed that the Italians were only 50 miles away and closing for battle. Rapid fire between the two forces continued as the distance between them dropped, but the Italians outgunned the British. The tables turned in favour of the British when the battlecruiser Renown closed the distance on the Italian cruisers. This advantage was soon negated when Vittorio Veneto opened fire from 29,000 yards and fired 19 shells in seven salvoes. Both forces withdrew, the battle lasting a total of 54 minutes and causing little damage to either side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6043;Successful Naval Battle of the River Plate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6043;We have won the Naval Battle of the River Plate!\n\nThe Battle of the River Plate was fought on December 13, 1939. The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was found and engaged off the estuary of the River Plate off the coast of Argentina and Uruguay in South America. In the ensuing battle, the HMS Exeter was severely damaged and forced to retire, while HMS Ajax and HMS Achilles sustained moderate damage. Ajax and Achilles then shadowed the Graf Spee, which entered the neutral Uruguayan capital Montevideo. After Hans Langsdorff, the captain of the Graf Spee, was told that the limit of his stay could not be extended beyond 72 hours he scuttled his damaged ship - rather than face the overwhelmingly superior force that the British led him to believe had been assembled. Although the actual engagement between the German and Allied forces could be regarded as a German victory in terms of losses, the subsequent actions resulted in the overall battle being an Allied victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6044;Successful Naval Battle of the Denmark Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6044;We have won the Naval Battle of the Denmark Strait!\n\nThe Battle of the Denmark Strait was fought on 24 May 1941 between ships of the Royal Navy and the German Kriegsmarine. The British battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Hood fought the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, both of which were attempting to break out into the North Atlantic to destroy Allied merchant shipping. A shell from Bismarck struck Hood near her aft ammunition magazines. Soon afterwards Hood exploded and sank within three minutes with the loss of all but three of her crew. Prince of Wales continued to exchange fire with Bismarck but suffered serious malfunctions in her main armament as the battleship had not fully worked up after being completed in late March 1941. This, combined with the effects of the battle, caused her to break off the engagement. Bismarck, damaged but still very much operational, declined to chase Prince of Wales and instead headed for the Atlantic along with Prinz Eugen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6045;Successful Naval Battle of the Barents Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6045;We have won the Naval Battle of the Barents Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Barents Sea took place on 31 December 1942 between German surface raiders and British ships escorting convoy JW 51B to Kola Inlet in the USSR. The action took place in the Barents Sea north of North Cape, Norway. Because the battle took place in the middle of the polar night and both the German and British forces were scattered and unsure of the positions of the rest of their own forces, much less the enemy's, the entire battle was a rather confused affair. During the battle it was not clear who was firing on whom or even how many ships were engaged. Despite this German attack on convoy JW 51B, all fourteen of its merchant ships reached their destinations in the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6046;Successful Naval Battle of the Espero Convoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6046;We have won the Naval Battle of the Espero Convoy!\n\nThe Battle of the Espero Convoy took place southwest of Crete on June 28, 1940 and was fought between the Italian Regia Marina, the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. A force of seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers escorting three Allied convoys headed for Alexandria spotted a small Italian convoy. The Italian convoy consisted of three destroyers bound for Tobruk from Taranto. The five Allied cruisers attacked the surprised Italian convoy from a distance of 16,000 meters. When Baroni, commander of Espero, realised that the Italian forces were outgunned, he decided to sacrifice his ship in order to save the others. While Commander Baroni remained behind in his flagship to fight an unequal battle, the Zeffiro and Ostro headed safely to the southwest at full speed. The 7th Squadron spent about 5,000 rounds before the Espero was sent to the bottom, after two hours and ten minutes of fierce fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6047;Successful Naval Battle of the Java Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6047;We have won the Naval Battle of the Java Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Java Sea was a naval battle between the Allied Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese navy forces gathered to strike at Java, and on February 27 1942, the ABDA force engaged the Japanese in the Java Sea and the battle raged intermittently from mid-afternoon to midnight as the Allies tried to reach and attack the troop transports of the Java invasion fleet, but they were repulsed by superior firepower. Although the Allied fleet did not reach the invasion fleet, the battle did give the defenders of Java a one-day respite. The main ABDA naval force had been almost totally destroyed: 10 ships and approximately 2,173 sailors had been lost. The Battle of the Java Sea ended significant Allied naval operations in South-East Asia in 1942, and Japanese land forces invaded Java on February 28. The U.S. and Royal Air Force then started to retreat to Australia. The Japanese won this battle of attrition and ABDA forces surrendered on March 9.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6048;Successful Naval Battle of the Strait of Otranto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6048;We have won the Naval Battle of the Strait of Otranto!\n\nThe Battle of the Strait of Otranto took place on 12 November 1940. An Italian Navy convoy of four merchant ships was on its way back from Valona, Albania to Brindisi, Italy while escorted by the WWI era torpedo boat Fabrizi and the auxiliary cruiser Ramb III. Allied ships encountered six darkened enemy ships, including what they thought were two destroyers and four merchantmen. HMS Mohawk opened fire and HMAS Sydney attacked the leading freighter at a range of 11 km, setting it on fire. The other three merchantmen were either sunk or damaged and left burning. The Fabrizi was hit and heavily damaged and retired towards Valona with 11 dead and 17 wounded. The Ramb III after an initial exchange of 19 salvoes broke off the action unscathed. The merchantmen were all sunk in the action. The Allies suffered no damage or casualties, although a torpedo narrowly missed Sydney's stern. The Regia Marina casualties totalled 36 dead and 42 wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6049;Successful Naval Battle of Sunda Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6049;We have won the Naval Battle of Sunda Strait!\n\nThe Battle of Sunda Strait took place in the night of February 28 – March 1 1942, when the Australian cruiser HMAS Perth and the United States cruiser USS Houston fought an Imperial Japanese Navy task force. Both Allied ships were sunk after a fierce battle of several hours' duration. Five Japanese ships were sunk by friendly fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6050;Successful First Naval Battle of Sidra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6050;We have won the First Naval Battle of Sidra!\n\nThe First Battle of Sidra was a naval battle between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina and the engagement took place on 17 December 1941, east of Malta, in the Gulf of Sirte. The battle itself was relatively uneventful, but has come to describe a week of clashes which illustrate well the cut and thrust of naval warfare in the Mediterranean at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6051;Successful Second Naval Battle of Sidra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6051;We have won the Second Naval Battle of Sidra!\n\nThe Second Battle of Sirte took place on 22 March 1942 and was a naval engagement in which the escorting warships of a British convoy to Malta irritated a much more powerful Italian Navy squadron. The British convoy was composed of four merchant ships escorted by four light cruisers, one anti-aircraft cruiser, and eighteen destroyers. The Italian force comprised a battleship, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and eight destroyers. Despite the British victory, the battle delayed the convoy's planned arrival before dawn, which exposed it to intense and partly successful air attacks the following day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6052;Successful Second Naval Battle of Java;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6052;We have won the Second Naval Battle of Java!\n\nThe Second Battle of the Java Sea occurred on 1 March 1942 and was the last naval action of the Netherlands East Indies campaign. It saw the end of the last Allied ships operating in the waters around Java, allowing Japanese forces to complete their conquest of the Netherlands East Indies unhindered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6053;Successful Naval Battle of Ushant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6053;We have won the Naval Battle of Ushant!\n\nThe Battle of Ushant took place on 9 June 1944 and was an engagement between a Kriegsmarine destroyer flotilla and an Allied destroyer flotilla off the coast of Brittany. The engagement came shortly after the initial Allied landings in Normandy. After a confused engagement during the night the Allies sank one of the destroyers and forced the other ashore where she was wrecked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6054;Successful Naval Battle of the Crimean Peninsula;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6054;We have won the Naval Battle of the Crimean Peninsula!\n\nThe Crimea Campaign lasted from the summer of 1941 through to the first half of 1942, and was an attempt by Axis forces to conquer the Crimea peninsula. The German and Romanian troops suffered heavy casualties as they tried to advance through the isthmus linking the Crimean peninsula to the mainland at Perekop. From 26 September 1941 the German 11th Army was involved in the fighting opposed by the Red Army's 51st Army and elements of the Black Sea Fleet. By the close of the campaign, and during 1943 the peninsula was occupied by Army Group A with the 17th Army as its major subordinate formation. Once the German and Romanian troops broke through, they occupied most of the Crimea, with the exception of the city of Sevastopol. Sevastopol held out for 250 days from October 30, 1941 until July 4 1942, when the Germans finally captured the city. The campaign was completed with the second recapture of Kerch by German troops on 15 May 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6055;Successful Naval Battle of Milne Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6055;We have won the Naval Battle of Milne Bay!\n\nThe Battle of Milne Bay took place from 25 August 1942 to 5 September 1942. Japanese marines attacked the Australian base at Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea on 25 August and fighting continued until the Japanese retreated on 5 September. Armed resistance ended on 7 September 1942. The battle was the first in the Pacific campaign in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces, forcing them to withdraw and completely abandon their strategic objective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6056;Victorious First Indian Ocean Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6056;We have won the First Indian Ocean Raid!\n\nThe Indian Ocean raid took place from 31 March to 10 April 1942 and was a naval raid by the Fast Carrier Strike Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. The Japanese compelled the Allied forces to retreat to East Africa, leaving the Japanese unopposed in the Indian Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6057;Victorious Second Indian Ocean Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6057;We have won the Second Indian Ocean Raid!\n\nThe Second Indian Ocean raid took place when the Imperial Japanese Navy encountered the 6,100 ton British steamer Behar on the morning of 9 March. Upon sighting the Japanese ships Behar tried to get away but was shelled by the Japanese Cruiser Tone. The Japanese cruiser scored hits on Behar's prow and stern, killing three of her crew. The steamer sank shortly afterwards and Tone rescued 104 survivors. The Japanese turned back for the NEI that day and arrived at Batavia on 15 March. During this time the Behar survivors were held in harsh conditions on board Tone. On 16 March Tone disembarked fifteen Behar survivors, including the ship's chief officer and two women, at Tanjung Priok. On that night the remaining 89 prisoners were murdered on board Tone. The Indian Ocean raid was the last operation conducted by Axis surface raiders during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6058;Successful Naval Battle of New Georgia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6058;We have won the Naval Battle of New Georgia!\n\nThe New Georgia Campaign took place from June 20 to August 25 1943 between Allied forces and the Empire of Japan. The Japanese had captured New Georgia in 1942 and built an airbase at Munda Point that began operations in December 1942 to support the Guadalcanal offensives. The first Allied landings were on 20 June 1943 by the United States 4th Marine Raider Battalion at Segi Point on New Georgia. There was no resistance, and airfield construction began there on 30 June. From 12 July planes from Segi Point provided close air support for the battle. On 30 June, the 4th Raiders captured Viru Harbor. Munda point, the Japanese airbase on New Georgia Island, was the main objective of the assault on the island. This base was not taken until August 5, 1943. American forces secured the Japanese facilities at Bairoko Harbor, 13 km north of Munda, on 23 August, after weeks of difficult jungle operations. Fighting continued on islands west of New Georgia until October 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6059;Successful Naval Battle of Kwajalein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6059;We have won the Naval Battle of Kwajalein!\n\nThe Battle of Kwajalein was fought from January 31 to February 3 1944, on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The United States launched a successful twin assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north. The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance even though they were outnumbered and under-prepared. The determined defence of Roi-Namur left only 51 survivors of an original garrison of 3,500. For the United States, the battle represented a significant morale victory because it was the first time the United States penetrated the 'outer ring' of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defence.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6060;Successful Naval Battle of Truk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6060;We have won the Naval Battle of Truk!\n\nOn February 17-18 1944, the United States Navy attacked the Japanese naval and air base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. The U.S. attack involved a combination of air strikes, surface ship actions, and submarine attacks over two days. In total the attack sank three Japanese light cruisers, four destroyers, three auxiliary cruisers, two submarine tenders, three other smaller warships, an aircraft transport and 32 merchant ships. Over 250 Japanese aircraft were destroyed. The U.S. lost twenty-five aircraft. A night time torpedo attack by a Japanese aircraft from either Rabaul or Saipan damaged the Intrepid and killed 11 of her crew, forcing her to return to Pearl Harbor. Allied forces isolated Truk as they continued their advance towards Japan by invading other Pacific islands such as Guam, Saipan, Palau, and Iwo Jima. Cut off, the Japanese forces on Truk and other central Pacific islands ran low on food and faced starvation before Japan surrendered in August 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6061;Successful Naval Battle of Eniwetok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6061;We have won the Naval Battle of Eniwetok!\n\nThe Battle of Eniwetok took place from 17 February 1944 to 23 February 1944 on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The invasion of Eniwetok followed the American success in the battle of Kwajalein to the southeast. Naval bombardment of Eniwetok began on 17 February, and the 22nd Marine Regiment landed on Engebi Island, on the north side of the atoll, on 18 February. The island was secured within six hours. There was only a short bombardment on 19 February before the 106th Infantry Regiment went ashore on Eniwetok Island. The Japanese soldiers had strong positions, and the Americans were stopped by heavy automatic fire. The island was not secured until 21 February. 37 Americans were killed and more than 800 Japanese defenders died. The mistake was not repeated on Parry Island, which was bombarded intensely before the 22nd Marines landed there and met only light resistance. The atoll's remaining islands were captured on 23 February. Eniwetok Atoll provided a forward base for the United States Navy for its later operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6062;Successful Naval Battle of Tinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6062;We have won the Naval Battle of Tinian!\n\nThe Battle of Tinian took place from 24 July 1944 to 1 August 1944. The 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions landed on 24 July 1944, supported by naval bombardment and artillery firing across the strait from Saipan. The island was secured in nine days of fighting. On July 31, the surviving Japanese launched a suicide charge. The battle saw the first use of napalm in the Pacific. Of the 120 tanks dropped during the operation, 25 contained the napalm mixture and the rest an oil-gasoline mixture. The Japanese lost 8,010. Only 313 Japanese were taken prisoner. American losses stood at 328 dead and 1,571 wounded. After the battle, Tinian became an important base for further Allied operations in the Pacific Campaign. Camps were built for 50,000 troops. Fifteen thousand Seabees turned the island into the busiest airfield of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6063;Successful Naval Battle of Cabanatuan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6063;We have won the Naval Battle of Cabanatuan!\n\nThe Raid at Cabanatuan took place on January 30, 1945 and was a rescue mission near Cabanatuan by United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas that resulted in the liberation of 516 prisoners of war from a Japanese POW camp. After the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the battle for Bataan, many prisoners were sent to the Cabanatuan prisoner camp. As the Japanese removed the majority of the prisoners from the camp to other areas, just over 500 American and other Allied POWs remained. In late January 1945, a group of over a hundred Rangers and Scouts and several hundred guerrillas travelled 48 km behind Japanese lines to reach the camp. In a thirty-minute coordinated attack, hundreds of Japanese troops were killed as the Americans suffered minimal casualties in rescuing the prisoners from the camp. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6064;Successful First Naval Battle of Savo Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6064;We have won the First Naval Battle of Savo Island!\n\nThe First Battle of Savo Island took place on August 8–9, 1942 between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval forces. Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and his Japanese naval force of seven cruisers and one destroyer attacked the British forces’ five cruisers and seven destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley VC. Mikawa surprised and routed the Allied force, sinking one Australian and three American cruisers, while suffering only moderate damage in return. The remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force withdrew from the Solomon Islands, temporarily conceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6065;Successful Second Naval Battle of Savo Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6065;We have won the Second Naval Battle of Savo Island!\n\nThe Second Battle of Savo Island took place from October 11 to 12, 1942 and was a naval battle between the Imperial Japanese Navy and United States Navy. On October 11, a U.S force of four cruisers and five destroyers intercepted the Japanese force. Taking the Japanese by surprise, the U.S warships sank one of the cruisers and one of the destroyers, heavily damaged another cruiser and forced the rest of the warships to abandon their bombardment mission and retreat. One of the U.S destroyers was sunk and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. In the meantime, the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by the U.S force. Later on the morning of October 12, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist the retreating, damaged warships. Air attacks by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6066;Successful Naval Battle of Makassar Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6066;We have won the Naval Battle of Makassar Strait!\n\nThe Battle of Makassar Strait took place on 4 February 1942. American, British and Dutch forces headed out for Makassar Strait in search of the Japanese invasion force, which was reported to be passing through the straits and was said to include three cruisers and 18 destroyers, escorting transports and other ships. Japanese planes attacked the Allied cruisers. The Marblehead sustained two direct hits which penetrated the deck, killed 15 crewmembers directly and destroyed the ship's ability to manoeuvre. Houston initially evaded bombs successfully, but suffered a severe hit during a final attack. A bomb hit the deck near the aft gun turret, and killed 48 crewmembers. The rear guns were rendered useless. Due to the threat from bombers, the Allied forces could not advance to Makassar Strait. The retreat of the strike force resulted in the Japanese taking control of Makassar Strait and thereby tightening their grip on the western part of the Dutch East Indies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6067;Successful Naval Battle of the Lofoten Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6067;We have won the Naval Battle of the Lofoten Islands!\n\nThe British Armed forces raided the Lofoten Islands in Norway on 4 March 1941. Approximately 1,000 men of No. 3 and No. 4 Commando, 52 Norwegians of Norwegian Independent Company 1 and demolition teams from the 55th Field Squadron Royal Engineers conducted the raid. The force made an unopposed landing and generally continued to meet no opposition. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some 3,600 tonnes of oil and glycerine. Through naval gunfire and demolition parties, 18,000 tons of shipping was sunk. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an Enigma cypher machine and its codebooks. This enabled German naval codes to be read at Bletchley Park, providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations. The British returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 loyal Norwegian volunteers and a number of Quisling collaborators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6068;Successful Naval Battle of the Seychelles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6068;We have won the Naval Battle of the Seychelles!\n\nThe battle was fought between the British heavy cruiser HMS Cornwall and the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin. The battle began when the Royal Navy sighted the Pinguin and challenged what they thought was a merchant freighter. Pinguin fired her main battery and at least one shell hit the Royal Navy warship, causing little damage but enough to force HMS Cornwall to seek repairs after the battle. The British responded and after receiving several hits at and below the water line, Pinguin began to sink and her crew abandoned their ship. Aboard the Pinguin were merchant sailors that had been taken captive by the Germans from over thirty different allied vessels. The Pinguin was just as much a prison as she was a warship. Only twenty-two of the 222 prisoners aboard the Pinguin survived. About 332 Germans were killed, sixty of who were rescued and later imprisoned. Only one British sailor was killed in the engagement. A total of 533 men lost their lives that day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6069;Successful Naval Battle of the Bismarck Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6069;We have won the Naval Battle of the Bismarck Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Bismarck Sea took place from 2 to 4 March 1943 and was a battle in which planes of the United States Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force attacked a Japanese convoy carrying troops to Lae, New Guinea. Most of the task force was destroyed, and Japanese troop losses were extremely high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6070;Successful Raid on Makin Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6070;We have won the Raid on Makin Island!\n\nThe Makin Island Raid took place from August 17, 1942 to August 18, 1942 and was an attack by the United States Marine Corps on the Japanese military. Although the Marine Raiders succeeded in annihilating the Japanese garrison on the island, the raid failed to meet its other material objectives. No Japanese prisoners were taken, and no meaningful intelligence was collected. Also, no significant Japanese forces were diverted from the Solomon Islands area. In fact, because the raid highlighted the vulnerabilities to their garrisons in the Gilbert Islands, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and defensive preparations on the islands in the central Pacific, which may have caused heavier losses for U.S. forces during the battles of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns. However, the raid did succeed in its objectives of boosting morale and testing Raider tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6071;Operation Jaywick Succeeded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6071;We have won the Naval Battle of Singapore!\n\nOperation Jaywick was a special operation undertaken in September 1943, when 14 Allied commandos from the Z Special Unit raided Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour, sinking seven ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6101;Unsuccessful Attack on Sydney Harbour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6101;We have lost the attack on Sydney Harbour!\n\nIn late May and early June 1942, submarines belonging to the Imperial Japanese Navy made a series of attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in Australia. On the night of 31 May - 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki class midget submarines entered Sydney Harbour and attempted to sink Allied warships. After being detected and attacked, the crews of two of the midget submarines scuttled their boats and committed suicide. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser USS Chicago, but instead sank the converted ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors. Immediately following the raid, the five Japanese fleet submarines that carried the midget submarines to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, two of the submarines bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6102;Disastrous Naval Battle of Narvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6102;We have lost the naval battle of Narvik!\n\nThe Battle of Narvik was fought from 9 April until 8 June 1940 as a naval battle in the Ofotfjord and as a land battle in the mountains surrounding the north Norwegian city of Narvik. The two naval battles in the Ofotfjord on 10 April and 13 April were fought between the British Royal Navy and the German Kriegsmarine. Narvik provided an ice-free harbour in the North Atlantic for iron ore transported by the railway from Kiruna in Sweden. Both sides in the war had an interest in securing this iron supply for themselves and denying it to the enemy, setting the stage for one of the first large-scale battles during the Second World War since the invasion of Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6103;Disastrous Naval Battle of the Danzig Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6103;We have lost the naval battle of the Danzig Bay!\n\nA minor battle took place on September 1 1939, at the beginning of the invasion of Poland, when German Luftwaffe aircraft attacked Polish Navy vessels in Danzig Bay. The Polish Navy had delegated one large minelayer, one destroyer, five submarines and smaller vessels to execute two major naval operations, both aimed at disrupting the German naval movement in the area of the Danzig Bay and transit movement between Germany and East Prussia.The flotilla was attacked by a group of 33 German warplanes. The air raid was mostly unsuccessful and the Polish vessels suffered only minor losses. However, soon after the first air raid was repelled, the German bombers returned. There were no direct hits, but the Polish ships suffered minor damage from close misses and machine gun fire. After successful defence against several consecutive air raids, the Polish flotilla arrived at Hel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6104;Disastrous Naval Battle of Taranto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6104;'We have lost the naval battle of Taranto!\n\nThe naval Battle of Taranto took place on the night of 11 November 1940 – 12 November 1940. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea and attacking the Italian fleet at harbour in Taranto. The effect of the British carrier-launched aircraft on the Italian warships foreshadowed the end of the 'big gun' ship and the rise of naval air power.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6105;Disastrous Naval Battle of Casablanca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6105;We have lost the naval battle of Casablanca!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Casablanca was fought between United States ships covering the invasion of North Africa and Vichy French ships defending the neutrality of French Morocco. The last stages of the battle consisted of operations by German U-boats which had reached the area after the French troops' surrender. An invasion task force of 102 American ships carrying 35,000 American soldiers approached the Moroccan coast undetected under cover of darkness. French defenders interpreted the first contacts as a diversionary raid for a major landing in Algeria, and regarded the surrender of six Moroccan divisions to a commando raid as a clear violation of the armistice. An escalating series of surprised responses in an atmosphere of mistrust and secrecy caused the loss of four United States troopships and the deaths of 462 men aboard twenty-four French ships opposing the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6106;Unsuccessful Sinking of an Enemy Ship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6106;We have failed at sinking the enemy ship!\n\nThe Action of 27 February 1941 was a single ship action between a New Zealand cruiser and an Italian auxiliary cruiser. The action began when the HMNZS Leander ordered a flagless freighter stopped for inspection. Instead of complying, the freighter, the Ramb I, hoisted the Italian colours and engaged the cruiser in a short battle. The action ended with the Leander sinking the Ramb I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6107;Disastrous Naval Battle between HMAS Sydney and Kormoran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6107;We have lost the naval battle!\n\nThe battle between HMAS Sydney and the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran was a half-hour long engagement which occurred during the late afternoon of 19 November 1941. It resulted in the destruction of both vessels. After Sydney failed to return to port, air and sea searches for the cruiser were conducted between 24 and 29 November. Three boats and two rafts carrying German survivors were recovered by merchant ships, while another two German boats made landfall north of Carnarvon, Western Australia: 318 of the 399 personnel from Kormoran survived. However, apart from two life preserving devices, no sign was found of Sydney or the 645 aboard. It was the largest loss of life in the history of the Royal Australian Navy, and the largest Allied warship lost with all hands during World War II. Australian authorities learned of Sydney’s fate by interrogating the Germans, who were then placed in prisoner of war camps until the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6108;Unsuccessful Bombardment of Fort Stevens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6108;We have lost the naval battle of Fort Stevens!\n\nThe Bombardment of Fort Stevens was an engagement during the early months of the Pacific War. The action was commenced by an Imperial Japanese submarine against the United States military installation Fort Stevens, protecting the Oregon side of the Columbia River's Pacific entrance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6109;Brutal defeat off Bougainville;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6109;We have been defeated!\n\nThe Action off Bougainville was a naval air/sea engagement in the South Pacific near Bougainville, Papua New Guinea on 20 February 1942. In the engagement, a United States Navy aircraft carrier task force on its way to raid the Imperial Japanese military base at Rabaul, New Britain was attacked by a force of land-based bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The US task force was commanded by Admiral Wilson Brown and the Japanese aircraft forces were under the command of Eiji Goto.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6110;Disastrous Naval Battle of the Caribbean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6110;We have lost the naval battle of the Caribbean!\n\nThe Battle of the Caribbean was fought from 1942 until 1945. German U-boats attempted to disrupt the Allied supply of oil and other materials. Improved Allied anti-submarine warfare eventually drove the U-boats out of the Caribbean, resulting in an Allied victory. German submarines shelled a Standard Oil refinery on Dutch-owned Aruba on 16 February 1942, causing no damage. A German submarine shelled the island of Mona, some 40 miles from Puerto Rico, on 3 March. No damage or casualties resulted. An oil refinery on Curaçao was shelled on 19 April. On 11 September 1942 German U-Boat U-514, under Kapitänleutnant Hans-Jürgen Auffermann, torpedoed the Canadian steam merchant SS Cornwallis, which sank in shallow waters, but was raised and towed to Trinidad in December 1942 and later towed to Mobile, arriving on 24 January 1943. The ship was repaired and returned to service in August 1943, but was torpedoed a second time, this time on 3 December 1944, and sank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6111;Disastrous Naval Battle of Empress Augusta Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6111;We have lost the naval battle of Empress Augusta Bay!\n\nThe Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 1–2 November 1943 was a naval battle fought near the island of Bougainville. The naval battle was a result of Allied landings on nearby Bougainville in the first action in the Bougainville campaign and may also be seen as part of the Solomon and New Guinea campaigns. The battle was significant as part of a broader Allied strategy aimed at isolating and surrounding the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The intention was to establish a beachhead on Bougainville, within which an airfield would be built. On 1 November 1943 the US 3rd Marine Division landed at Cape Torokina in Empress Augusta Bay. The bay had been chosen because it was at the outer limit of Allied fighter plane range, and because the numerically superior Japanese 17th Army was concentrated at other, more strategic sites in the north and the south. A force of four light cruisers and eight destroyers backed the Marines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6112;Unsuccessful Attacks on Nauru;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6112;We have lost the naval battle of Nauru!\n\nGerman auxiliary cruisers attacked the Australian-administered Pacific island of Nauru on two occasions in December 1940. These attacks sank five Allied merchant ships and inflicted serious damage on the island's important phosphate-loading facilities. The two attacks were the most effective conducted by German raiders in the Pacific during the war. They disrupted the supplies of phosphate to Australia, New Zealand and Japan and led to Allied naval vessels being deployed to protect the islands and shipping in the South Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6113;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Suursaari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6113;We have lost the naval battle of Suursaari!\n\nOperation Tanne Ost took place on September 15, 1944 and was a German operation to capture the Finnish-held island Suursaari in the Gulf of Finland during the Lapland War. Suursaari was important because it worked as a lock in the Finnish Gulf guarding the minefields keeping the Soviet Baltic Fleet in Kronstadt. On September 15 1944, German ships approached Suursaari and the Finnish crews on the island opened fire. Most of the troops made it to the beaches, but there the difficulties continued, somewhat because of the Finnish defence being much more numerous than expected. After sunrise the Soviets made bombing runs on the German ships and later bombed both German and Finnish positions on the island. A second wave of troops was withdrawn before they could land. Finnish Navy motor torpedo boats sank several German vessels. After that German ships decided to leave because they failed to make radio contact with the landed troops. The operation ended in a complete failure, with the Finns capturing 1,231 German prisoners. Soviet Air Force made three attacks against German positions and ships. The attacks also caused some Finnish casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6114;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Calabria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6114;We have lost the naval battle of Calabria!\n\nThe Battle of Calabria was a naval battle during the Battle of the Mediterranean. It was fought between vessels of the Italian Regia Marina on one side and vessels of the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy on the other. The battle occurred thirty miles to the east of Punta Stilo, on 9 July 1940. It was one of the few pitched battles of the Mediterranean campaign, involving large numbers of ships on both sides. Both sides claimed victory, but in fact the battle was a draw and everyone returned to their bases as soon as possible. After the battle a massive propaganda effort on the part of the Allies tried to convince the Italian forces that the Allies had won outright. Italian propaganda also depicted this battle as an Axis victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6115;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Cape Spada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6115;We have lost the naval battle of Cape Spada!\n\nThe Battle of Cape Spada took place on 19 July 1940 and was a naval battle during the Battle of the Mediterranean. The battle occurred when an Allied squadron patrolling the Aegean encountered two Italian cruisers transferring from Tripoli to Leros, at that time an Italian colony in the Dodecanese Islands. The destroyers led the Italian cruisers on a chase northwards to give HMS Sydney time to come to the rescue. Sydney sighted the Italians and opened fire, and the Italian cruisers turned away to the southwest. In the running battle, Sydney hit Bartolomeo Colleoni hard and after a shell hit the boilers she stopped dead in the water. She fought on but was unable to manoeuvre and torpedoes from HMS Ilex and HMS Hyperion sank her. Sydney disengaged because she was short of ammunition and Giovanni delle Bande Nere returned to Benghazi. 555 survivors of Bartolomeo Colleoni were rescued and 121 died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6116;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Guadalcanal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6116;We have lost the naval battle of Guadalcanal!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Guadalcanal took place between November 12 and November 15, 1942. Allied forces had landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942 and seized an airfield that was under construction by the Japanese military. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. In the resulting battle, both sides lost numerous warships. The U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Air attacks by Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6117;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Komandorski Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6117;We have lost the naval battle of the Komdandorski Islands!\n\nThe Battle of the Komandorski Islands that took place on 27 March 1943 was one of the most unusual engagements of World War II. When the United States became aware of Japanese plans to send a supply convoy to garrisons on the Aleutian Islands, U.S. Navy ships commanded by Rear Admiral Charles McMorris were dispatched to intercept. On the morning of 27 March, the Japanese convoy was intercepted by the U.S. picket line and combat ensued. When the Japanese force was poised for victory, Admiral Hosogaya - not realizing the heavy damage his ships had inflicted on Salt Lake City, and fearing American air forces were en route - chose to retire without delivering a knockout blow. Withdrawal led to a strategic defeat for the Japanese because it ended their attempts to resupply their Aleutian garrisons by surface, leaving only submarines for resupply runs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6118;Humiliating Landing at Aitape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6118;We have been defeated at Aitape!\n\nThe Landing at Aitape was a battle of the Western New Guinea campaign. American and allied forces undertook an amphibious landing on 22 April 1944 at Aitape on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. The Japanese had occupied Aitape on 1 April 1942 and built Tadji Airfield a few miles southeast near the coast. The landing took place at Wapil on 22 April 1944. The 163rd Regimental Combat Team landed and opposition was light, with most Japanese defenders fleeing into the hills as the overwhelming force continued to arrive. One landing force transport was badly damaged by a Japanese torpedo bomber. The airfield was secured by 13:00hrs on 22 April and the fighter strip was made operational by the RAAF No. 62 Works Wing within forty-eight hours after working nonstop. Twenty-five P-40s from the No. 78 Wing of the RAAF landed on the field on 24 April, with the rest of the wing arriving the next day to provide support to the Aitape and Hollandia landings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6119;Humiliating Landing at Hollandia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6119;We have been defeated at Hollandia!\n\nThe Landing at Hollandia was a battle of the Western New Guinea campaign. American and allied forces undertook an amphibious landing on 22 April 1944 at Hollandia on the northern coast of Dutch New Guinea. The amphibious landing was undertaken simultaneously with the amphibious landings of Operation Persecution at Aitape to isolate the Japanese 18th Army at Wewak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6120;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Madagascar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6120;We have lost the naval battle of Madagascar!\n\nThe Battle of Madagascar began on 5 May 1942. Fighting did not cease until 6 November. Allied leaders believed that ports on Madagascar might be used by Japan, an idea shared by the German Navy. Allied commanders decided to launch an amphibious assault on Madagascar. The Allied naval contingent consisted of over 50 vessels. Vichy forces included about 8,000 troops. Between 1,500 and 3,000 Vichy troops were concentrated around Diego Suarez. Following fierce fighting, Diego Suarez was surrendered on 7 May. On 10 September the 29th Brigade and 22nd Brigade Group made an amphibious landing at Majunga. In addition to occasional small-scale clashes with enemy forces, they also encountered scores of obstacles erected on the main roads by Vichy soldiers. The Allies eventually captured the capital, Tananarive, and then the town of Ambalavao. The last major action was at Andriamanalina on 18 October. The Vichy French commander Annet surrendered on 8 November.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6121;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Attu and Kiska;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6121;We have lost the naval battle of Attu and Kiska!\n\nThe Battle of Attu took place from May 11, 1943 to May 30, 1943. A force of primarily United States Army soldiers landed on Attu with the goal of retaking the island from Japanese forces that had occupied the island since October 1942. The Japanese troops on the island put up a more effective defence than the Americans had anticipated. With some difficulty, the Americans were able to push the Japanese commander Yamasaki's men into a pocket near the coast of the island. Yamasaki and his remaining troops launched a surprise counter attack, executing a Banzai charge that broke through the American front line. Japanese troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with shocked American rear-echelon troops until most of the Japanese were killed. This charge effectively ended the battle for the island. Attu was the last ground combat in the campaign. The Japanese successfully evacuated their garrison on nearby Kiska on July 28, 1943 ending the Japanese presence in the Aleutian Islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6122;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Palau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6122;We have lost the naval battle of Palau!\n\nThe Palau Island campaign was an offensive launched by United States forces against Imperial Japanese forces in the Palau Island between June and November, 1944. The United States offensive intended to neutralize Japanese bases in the central Pacific, support the Allied drive to retake the Philippines, and provide bases for a strategic bombing campaign against Japan. United States Marine Corps and United States Army forces, with support from the United States Navy, executed landings on Saipan in June, 1944. In response, the Imperial Japanese Navy's combined fleet sortied out to attack the U.S. Navy fleet supporting the landings. In September 1944, U.S. Marine and Army forces landed on the islands of Peleliu and Angaur in Palau. After heavy and intense combat on Peleliu, U.S. forces finally secured the island in November, 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6123;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Okinawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6123;We have lost the naval battle of Okinawa!\n\nThe Battle of Okinawa was fought on the Ryukyu Islands of Okinawa and was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The 82-day-long battle lasted from early April until mid-June, 1945. The battle has been referred to as the ‘Typhoon of Steel’. The nickname refers to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of gunfire involved, and to the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle resulted in one of the highest numbers of casualties of any World War Two engagement. Japan lost over 100,000 troops, and the Allies suffered more than 50,000 casualties, with over 12,000 killed in action. The invasion was supported by naval, amphibious, and tactical air forces. The Allies planned to use Okinawa as a base for air operations in the planned invasion of the Japanese mainland, coded Operation Downfall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6124;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Philippines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6124;We have lost the naval battle of Philippines!\n\nThe Battle of the Philippines was the invasion of the Philippines by Japan in 1941–1942 and the defence of the islands by Filipino and United States forces. The defending forces outnumbered the Japanese invaders by 3:2, but were poorly trained and equipped, while the Japanese used their best first-line troops at the outset of the campaign. The Japanese 14th Army also concentrated its forces in the first month of the campaign, enabling it to swiftly overrun most of Luzon. The Japanese high command made a strategic decision to advance by a month their timetable of operations in Borneo and Indonesia, withdrawing their best division and the bulk of their airpower in early January 1942. This, coupled with the decision of the defenders to withdraw into a defensive holding position in the Bataan Peninsula, enabled the Americans and Filipinos to successfully hold out for four more months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6125;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Dutch Harbor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6125;We have lost the naval battle of Dutch Harbor!\n\nA minor naval battle called the Battle of Dutch Harbor took place from June 3 to June 4, 1942. The battle was fought between Imperial Japanese Navy and United States Army and Navy forces. On June 3, 12 dive-bombers arrived over the harbor and attacked the town's radio station and oil storage tanks. The first day of the Dutch Harbor air raid inflicted very little damage on the U.S. forces in the area. On June 4, a second airstrike of nine fighters, 11 dive bombers, and six high-level bombers attacked the U.S. facilities at Dutch Harbor again. When the Japanese returned on 4 June, the Zero's concentrated on strafing the gun positions while their bombers destroyed the fuel tanks located at the harbor. On June 5, Admiral Kakuta, the commander of the Japanese navy involved in the battle, received orders to break off further attacks and head for the central Pacific to support the Combined Fleet which was retreating after being defeated at Midway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6126;Unsuccessful First Naval Battle of Narvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6126;We have lost the first naval battle of Narvik!\n\nThe first battle of Narvik occurred after the German invasion of Norway. The Royal Navy saw an opportunity to defeat the Kriegsmarine, so the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla moved up the fjord. When the British flotilla approached Narvik, they surprised and engaged a German force at the entrance to the harbor and sank two destroyers, heavily damaged another and inflicted lesser damage on two others. Five more German destroyers then engaged the British flotilla. In the ensuing battle, two British destroyers were lost. A third was also damaged badly by a torpedo. The remaining British destroyers left the battlefield. The German destroyers, now short of fuel and ammunition, did not pursue the British ships. Soon the German naval forces were blocked in by British reinforcements. As the British destroyers left the Vestfjord outside Narvik, two German submarines fired torpedoes at them, but these detonated well before their targets or not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6127;Unsuccessful Second Naval Battle of Narvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6127;We have lost the second naval battle of Narvik!\n\nThe second naval battle of Narvik occurred on 13 April 1940 when the British Royal Navy sent the battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers, accompanied by aircraft from the aircraft carrier HMS Furious to Ofotfjord. The naval forces found that the eight remaining German destroyers were virtually stranded due to lack of fuel and were short of ammunition. In the ensuing battle, Warspite and her escorts sank three of the German destroyers, and their own crews scuttled the other five when they ran out of fuel and ammunition. British aircraft from Furious tried to engage the German destroyers but were unsuccessful: two were lost. Finally, when the German destroyers were low on ammunition, they retreated. The only German ship that survived within the port area was the submarine U-51. Shore batteries and installations were also very badly damaged by Warspite's guns. On the Allied side, the damage to HMS Eskimo kept her in Norway until 31 May 1940.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6128;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Manado;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6128;We have lost the naval battle of Manado!\n\nThe Battle of Manado took place from January 11 to 13, 1942. The main Japanese fleet was intended to land at Manado, Kendari, Ambon, Makassar, Timor and Bali. On January 11 1942, the Japanese fleet landed at two places, at Kema and at Manado. The defending units in Manado were not enough to oppose thousands of Japanese amphibious assault on January 11, 1942. They retreated to Tinoör stronghold, located some five miles inland. The fighting at Tinoör lasted until the defenders ran out of ammunition and had to retreat to Kakaskasen. After securing Manado the Japanese Force moved southward and landed north of Kendari. Kendari airfield was quickly secured with little resistance. By the evening of January 24, 1942 Kendari was fully occupied. Kendari Air Base became the base for the Japanese 21st Air Flotilla operation. Slightly south of Kendari, a main naval base at Staring Bay was constructed to become an important refuelling checkpoint in that area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6129;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Tarakan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6129;We have lost the naval battle of Tarakan!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Tarakan took place on January 11–12, 1942. Tarakan had 700 oil wells, an oil refinery and an airfield on it and was one of the main objectives for the Empire of Japan in the Pacific War. On January 10, 1942 a Dutch Dornier Do 24K flying boat spotted an incoming Japanese invasion fleet and the Dutch Commander ordered the destruction of all oil fields on the island. The Japanese forces landed on the east coast of Tarakan at midnight on 11 January 1942. The Royal Netherlands Indies Army mounted a brief but fierce resistance but the outnumbered garrison surrendered in the morning of January 12. All prisoners of war were executed by the Japanese in retaliation for the destruction of the oil installations. Tarakan remained under Japanese occupation until May 1945 when it was liberated by Australian troops in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6130;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Portugese Timor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6130;We have lost the naval battle of Portugese Timor!\n\nThe Battle of Timor occurred when Japanese forces invaded the island on 20 February 1942 and were resisted by a small, under-equipped force of Allied military personnel predominantly from Australia and the Netherlands East Indies. The Japanese succeeded in forcing the surrender of the bulk of the Allied force after three days of fighting, however several hundred Australian commandos continued to wage an unconventional raiding campaign. Aircraft and vessels, based mostly in Darwin, Australia, across the Timor Sea, resupplied them. The campaign lasted until 10 February 1943, when the final remaining Australians were evacuated. As a result, an entire Japanese division was tied up on Timor for more than six months, preventing its deployment elsewhere. Tens of thousands of Timorese civilians died as a result of the Japanese occupation, which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6132;Unsuccessful Naval Battle for Henderson Field;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6132;We have lost the naval battle for Henderson Field!\n\nThe Battle for Henderson Field took place from October 23 to October 26, 1942. The U.S. forces were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies. The Japanese force was sent to Guadalcanal with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island. The Japanese soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter, but all were repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers. At the same time, Allied aircraft operating from Henderson Field successfully defended U.S. positions on Guadalcanal from attacks by Japanese naval, air, and sea forces. After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and successfully evacuated many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6133;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Balikpapan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6133;We have lost the naval battle of Balikpapan!\n\nThe Naval Battle of Balikpapan took place on January 23–24, 1942. After capturing the oilfield at Tarakan, the Japanese force moved forward to Balikpapan, hoping that the oilfields there had not been destroyed. The Dutch forces in Balikpapan numbered approximately 1,100 troops. On January 18, the Dutch commander ordered the destruction of the oilfields in Balikpapan and started to evacuate his staff to Samarinda. However, the only serious damage was to tanks, pipes and special quays in the harbor area. On January 22, the Japanese fleet was attacked by Dutch bomber formations. The Japanese unit successfully landed at approximately 5 kilometers southeast of Balikpapan airfield without meeting enemy resistance and occupied the airfield. The Japanese entered Balikpapan city on January 25 without a fight. Balikpapan remained under Japanese control until July 1945 when the Japanese force was defeated by Australian troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6134;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Anzio;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6134;We have lost the naval battle of Anzio!\n\nThe Battle of Anzio or Operation Shingle was an Allied amphibious landing against Axis forces in the area of Anzio, Italy. The operation was intended to outflank German forces of the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome. On the day of the amphibious landing, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles landed on the beaches. On January 24, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions at Anzio. Further troop movements brought Allied forces total on the beachhead to 69,000 men, 508 guns and 208 tanks by January 29, whilst the total defending Germans had risen to 71,500. By early February the German Fourteenth Army numbered some 100,000 troops organised into two Army Corps, the 1st Parachute Corps and the LXXVI Panzer Corps. Allied forces by this time totalled 76,400. After much hard and intense fighting, the Allies finally reached Rome and entered the city in the early hours of June 5.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6135;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Leyte Gulf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6135;We have lost the naval battle of Leyte Gulf!\n\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf was the largest naval battle of World War II and also one of the largest naval battles in history. The battle was fought from 23 to 26 October 1944 and it was fought between naval and naval-air forces of the Allies and those of the Empire of Japan. On 20 October, the United States invaded the island of Leyte as part of a strategy aimed at isolating Japan from the countries it had occupied in South East Asia, and in particular depriving its forces and industry of vital oil supplies. The Imperial Japanese Navy mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion, but was repulsed by the US Navy's 3rd and 7th Fleets. The IJN failed to achieve its objective, suffered very heavy losses, and never afterwards sailed to battle in comparable force. The majority of its surviving heavy ships, deprived of petroleum fuel, remained in their bases for the rest of the Pacific War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6136;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Coral Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6136;We have lost the naval battle of the Coral Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Coral Sea took place from May 4 to May 8, 1942 and was a naval battle between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. On 3 and 4 May, Japanese forces successfully invaded and occupied Tulagi. Beginning 7 May, the carrier forces from the two sides exchanged air strikes over two consecutive days. Both sides suffered heavy losses in aircraft and carriers damaged or sunk. The two fleets disengaged and retired from the battle area and although it was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, the battle would prove to be a strategic victory for the Allies. Japanese expansion had been turned back for the first time and two Japanese fleet carriers were unable to participate in the battle of Midway, which took place the following month, ensuring a rough parity in aircraft between the two adversaries and contributing significantly to the U.S. victory in that battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6137;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Mindoro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6137;We have lost the naval battle of Mindoro!\n\nThe Battle of Mindoro, fought from 13 December to 16 December 1944, was fought between U.S. and Japanese forces at Mindoro Island and was part of the penultimate campaign for the liberation of the Philippines. On 13 December 1944, kamikazes struck at the U.S. naval task force ferrying the troops to Mindoro. The light cruiser Nashville was hit by a kamikaze, killing over 130 men and wounding another 190. Other kamikaze attacks damaged two tank landing ships and disabled several other ships. On 15 December, the invasion of Mindoro began. American air and naval power included six escort carriers, three battleships, six cruisers and many other support warships. The 1,000 defending Japanese, along with some 200 survivors from ships sunk off Mindoro en route to Leyte were outnumbered and outgunned. The island was secure within 48 hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6138;Unsuccessful Naval Battle off Samar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6138;We have lost the naval battle off Samar!\n\nThe Battle off Samar took place on 25 October 1944. Admiral William Halsey Junior was lured into taking his powerful 3rd Fleet after a decoy fleet. This left only three escort carrier groups of the 7th Fleet in the area. A powerful Japanese surface force of battleships and cruisers that were thought to have been defeated and in retreat instead turned around unobserved and stumbled upon the northernmost of the three groups, Task Unit 77.4.3 or ‘Taffy 3’. Taffy 3's destroyers and destroyer escorts desperately attacked with 5-inch guns and torpedoes, while carrier aircraft dropped bombs and depth charges. While US vessels leading the counter-attack suffered heavy personnel losses, they sank or disabled three Japanese cruisers and caused enough confusion to convince the Japanese commander, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, to regroup and ultimately withdraw, rather than advancing to sink troop and supply ships at Leyte Gulf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6139;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Midway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6139;We have lost the naval battle of Midway!\n\nThe Battle of Midway is widely regarded as the most important naval battle of the Pacific Campaign. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, approximately one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea and six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Navy decisively defeated an Imperial Japanese Navy attack against Midway Atoll, inflicting irreparable damage on the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6140;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Hel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6140;We have lost the naval battle of Hel!\n\nThe Battle of Hel took place from September 9 until October 2, 1939. Approximately 3,000 soldiers of the Fortified Region Hel defended the area against overwhelming odds. The German army began the assault of the Polish forces in Hel on 9 September. Hel defenders damaged a German destroyer on 3 September. After the Luftwaffe sank some of them on the following day, due to German control of the Baltic Sea, the remaining units docked at Hel port and the crews joined the ground forces. German naval units, including old battleships Schleswig-Holstein and Schlesien, shelled the Hel peninsula from 18 September, but with little effect. Polish coastal batteries lightly damaged Schleswig-Holstein on 25 September. By September 14 Polish forces on Hel were cut off from the mainland. On October 1, Polish forces on Hel capitulated due to shortages of supplies. The Germans occupied the peninsula by October 2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6141;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Cape Matapan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6141;We have lost the naval battle of Cape Matapan!\n\nThe Battle of Cape Matapan was a naval battle fought from March 27 to March 29, 1941. A force of British Royal Navy ships accompanied by several Royal Australian Navy ships, under command of British Admiral Andrew Cunningham, intercepted and sank or severely damaged the ships of the Italian Regia Marina under Admiral Angelo Iachino.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6142;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Cape Spartivento;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6142;We have lost the naval battle of Cape Spartivento!\n\nThe Battle of Cape Spartivento was fought on 27 November 1940, between the British Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina. On the night of 17 November, Italian forces were about to intercept British cruisers and two carriers on their way to deliver aircraft to Malta. The British convoy was warned of their approach and immediately returned to Gibraltar. The convoy was rerun, with much more support. On the 27th, the British were informed that the Italians were only 50 miles away and closing for battle. Rapid fire between the two forces continued as the distance between them dropped, but the Italians outgunned the British. The tables turned in favour of the British when the battlecruiser Renown closed the distance on the Italian cruisers. This advantage was soon negated when Vittorio Veneto opened fire from 29,000 yards and fired 19 shells in seven salvoes. Both forces withdrew, the battle lasting a total of 54 minutes and causing little damage to either side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6143;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the River Plate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6143;We have lost the naval battle of the River Plate!\n\nThe Battle of the River Plate was fought on December 13, 1939. The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was found and engaged off the estuary of the River Plate off the coast of Argentina and Uruguay in South America. In the ensuing battle, the HMS Exeter was severely damaged and forced to retire, while HMS Ajax and HMS Achilles sustained moderate damage. Ajax and Achilles then shadowed the Graf Spee, which entered the neutral Uruguayan capital Montevideo. After Hans Langsdorff, the captain of the Graf Spee, was told that the limit of his stay could not be extended beyond 72 hours he scuttled his damaged ship - rather than face the overwhelmingly superior force that the British led him to believe had been assembled. Although the actual engagement between the German and Allied forces could be regarded as a German victory in terms of losses, the subsequent actions resulted in the overall battle being an Allied victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6144;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Denmark Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6144;We have lost the naval battle of the Denmark Strait!\n\nThe Battle of the Denmark Strait was fought on 24 May 1941 between ships of the Royal Navy and the German Kriegsmarine. The British battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Hood fought the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, both of which were attempting to break out into the North Atlantic to destroy Allied merchant shipping. A shell from Bismarck struck Hood near her aft ammunition magazines. Soon afterwards Hood exploded and sank within three minutes with the loss of all but three of her crew. Prince of Wales continued to exchange fire with Bismarck but suffered serious malfunctions in her main armament as the battleship had not fully worked up after being completed in late March 1941. This, combined with the effects of the battle, caused her to break off the engagement. Bismarck, damaged but still very much operational, declined to chase Prince of Wales and instead headed for the Atlantic along with Prinz Eugen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6145;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Barents Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6145;We have lost the naval battle of the Barents Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Barents Sea took place on 31 December 1942 between German surface raiders and British ships escorting convoy JW 51B to Kola Inlet in the USSR. The action took place in the Barents Sea north of North Cape, Norway. Because the battle took place in the middle of the polar night and both the German and British forces were scattered and unsure of the positions of the rest of their own forces, much less the enemy's, the entire battle was a rather confused affair. During the battle it was not clear who was firing on whom or even how many ships were engaged. Despite this German attack on convoy JW 51B, all fourteen of its merchant ships reached their destinations in the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6146;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Espero Convoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6146;We have lost the naval battle of the Espero Convoy!\n\nThe Battle of the Espero Convoy took place southwest of Crete on June 28, 1940 and was fought between the Italian Regia Marina, the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. A force of seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers escorting three Allied convoys headed for Alexandria spotted a small Italian convoy. The Italian convoy consisted of three destroyers bound for Tobruk from Taranto. The five Allied cruisers attacked the surprised Italian convoy from a distance of 16,000 meters. When Baroni, commander of Espero, realised that the Italian forces were outgunned, he decided to sacrifice his ship in order to save the others. While Commander Baroni remained behind in his flagship to fight an unequal battle, the Zeffiro and Ostro headed safely to the southwest at full speed. The 7th Squadron spent about 5,000 rounds before the Espero was sent to the bottom, after two hours and ten minutes of fierce fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6147;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Java Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6147;We have lost the naval battle of the Java Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Java Sea was a naval battle between the Allied Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese navy forces gathered to strike at Java, and on February 27 1942, the ABDA force engaged the Japanese in the Java Sea and the battle raged intermittently from mid-afternoon to midnight as the Allies tried to reach and attack the troop transports of the Java invasion fleet, but they were repulsed by superior firepower. Although the Allied fleet did not reach the invasion fleet, the battle did give the defenders of Java a one-day respite. The main ABDA naval force had been almost totally destroyed: 10 ships and approximately 2,173 sailors had been lost. The Battle of the Java Sea ended significant Allied naval operations in South-East Asia in 1942, and Japanese land forces invaded Java on February 28. The U.S. and Royal Air Force then started to retreat to Australia. The Japanese won this battle of attrition and ABDA forces surrendered on March 9.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6148;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Strait of Otranto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6148;We have lost the naval battle of the Strait of Ontranto!\n\nThe Battle of the Strait of Otranto took place on 12 November 1940. An Italian Navy convoy of four merchant ships was on its way back from Valona, Albania to Brindisi, Italy while escorted by the WWI era torpedo boat Fabrizi and the auxiliary cruiser Ramb III. Allied ships encountered six darkened enemy ships, including what they thought were two destroyers and four merchantmen. HMS Mohawk opened fire and HMAS Sydney attacked the leading freighter at a range of 11 km, setting it on fire. The other three merchantmen were either sunk or damaged and left burning. The Fabrizi was hit and heavily damaged and retired towards Valona with 11 dead and 17 wounded. The Ramb III after an initial exchange of 19 salvoes broke off the action unscathed. The merchantmen were all sunk in the action. The Allies suffered no damage or casualties, although a torpedo narrowly missed Sydney's stern. The Regia Marina casualties totalled 36 dead and 42 wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6149;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Sunda Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6149;We have lost the naval battle of Sunda Strait!\n\nThe Battle of Sunda Strait took place in the night of February 28 – March 1 1942, when the Australian cruiser HMAS Perth and the United States cruiser USS Houston fought an Imperial Japanese Navy task force. Both Allied ships were sunk after a fierce battle of several hours' duration. Five Japanese ships were sunk by friendly fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6150;Unsuccessful First Naval Battle of Sidra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6150;We have lost the first naval battle of Sidra!\n\nThe First Battle of Sidra was a naval battle between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina and the engagement took place on 17 December 1941, east of Malta, in the Gulf of Sirte. The battle itself was relatively uneventful, but has come to describe a week of clashes which illustrate well the cut and thrust of naval warfare in the Mediterranean at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6151;Unsuccessful Second Naval Battle of Sidra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6151;We have lost the second naval battle of Sidra!\n\nThe Second Battle of Sirte took place on 22 March 1942 and was a naval engagement in which the escorting warships of a British convoy to Malta irritated a much more powerful Italian Navy squadron. The British convoy was composed of four merchant ships escorted by four light cruisers, one anti-aircraft cruiser, and eighteen destroyers. The Italian force comprised a battleship, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and eight destroyers. Despite the British victory, the battle delayed the convoy's planned arrival before dawn, which exposed it to intense and partly successful air attacks the following day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6152;Unsuccessful Second Naval Battle of Java;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6152;We have lost the second naval battle of Java!\n\nThe Second Battle of the Java Sea occurred on 1 March 1942 and was the last naval action of the Netherlands East Indies campaign. It saw the end of the last Allied ships operating in the waters around Java, allowing Japanese forces to complete their conquest of the Netherlands East Indies unhindered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6153;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Ushant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6153;We have lost the naval battle of Ushant!\n\nThe Battle of Ushant took place on 9 June 1944 and was an engagement between a Kriegsmarine destroyer flotilla and an Allied destroyer flotilla off the coast of Brittany. The engagement came shortly after the initial Allied landings in Normandy. After a confused engagement during the night the Allies sank one of the destroyers and forced the other ashore where she was wrecked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6154;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Crimean Peninsula;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6154;We have lost the naval battle of the Crimean Peninsula!\n\nThe Crimea Campaign lasted from the summer of 1941 through to the first half of 1942, and was an attempt by Axis forces to conquer the Crimea peninsula. The German and Romanian troops suffered heavy casualties as they tried to advance through the isthmus linking the Crimean peninsula to the mainland at Perekop. From 26 September 1941 the German 11th Army was involved in the fighting opposed by the Red Army's 51st Army and elements of the Black Sea Fleet. By the close of the campaign, and during 1943 the peninsula was occupied by Army Group A with the 17th Army as its major subordinate formation. Once the German and Romanian troops broke through, they occupied most of the Crimea, with the exception of the city of Sevastopol. Sevastopol held out for 250 days from October 30, 1941 until July 4 1942, when the Germans finally captured the city. The campaign was completed with the second recapture of Kerch by German troops on 15 May 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6155;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Milne Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6155;We have lost the naval battle of Milne Bay!\n\nThe Battle of Milne Bay took place from 25 August 1942 to 5 September 1942. Japanese marines attacked the Australian base at Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea on 25 August and fighting continued until the Japanese retreated on 5 September. Armed resistance ended on 7 September 1942. The battle was the first in the Pacific campaign in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces, forcing them to withdraw and completely abandon their strategic objective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6156;Brutal Defeat in the First Indian Ocean Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6156;We have lost the first naval battle of the Indian Ocean!\n\nThe Indian Ocean raid took place from 31 March to 10 April 1942 and was a naval raid by the Fast Carrier Strike Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. The Japanese compelled the Allied forces to retreat to East Africa, leaving the Japanese unopposed in the Indian Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6157;Brutal Defeat in the Second Indian Ocean Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6157;We have lost the second naval battle of the Indian Ocean!\n\nThe Second Indian Ocean raid took place when the Imperial Japanese Navy encountered the 6,100 ton British steamer Behar on the morning of 9 March. Upon sighting the Japanese ships Behar tried to get away but was shelled by the Japanese Cruiser Tone. The Japanese cruiser scored hits on Behar's prow and stern, killing three of her crew. The steamer sank shortly afterwards and Tone rescued 104 survivors. The Japanese turned back for the NEI that day and arrived at Batavia on 15 March. During this time the Behar survivors were held in harsh conditions on board Tone. On 16 March Tone disembarked fifteen Behar survivors, including the ship's chief officer and two women, at Tanjung Priok. On that night the remaining 89 prisoners were murdered on board Tone. The Indian Ocean raid was the last operation conducted by Axis surface raiders during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6158;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of New Georgia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6158;We have lost the naval battle of New Georgia!\n\nThe New Georgia Campaign took place from June 20 to August 25 1943 between Allied forces and the Empire of Japan. The Japanese had captured New Georgia in 1942 and built an airbase at Munda Point that began operations in December 1942 to support the Guadalcanal offensives. The first Allied landings were on 20 June 1943 by the United States 4th Marine Raider Battalion at Segi Point on New Georgia. There was no resistance, and airfield construction began there on 30 June. From 12 July planes from Segi Point provided close air support for the battle. On 30 June, the 4th Raiders captured Viru Harbor. Munda point, the Japanese airbase on New Georgia Island, was the main objective of the assault on the island. This base was not taken until August 5, 1943. American forces secured the Japanese facilities at Bairoko Harbor, 13 km north of Munda, on 23 August, after weeks of difficult jungle operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6159;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Kwajalein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6159;'We have lost the naval battle of Kwajalein!\n\nThe Battle of Kwajalein was fought from January 31 to February 3 1944, on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The United States launched a successful twin assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north. The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance even though they were outnumbered and under-prepared. The determined defence of Roi-Namur left only 51 survivors of an original garrison of 3,500. For the United States, the battle represented a significant morale victory because it was the first time the United States penetrated the 'outer ring' of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defence.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6160;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Truk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6160;We have lost the naval battle of Truk!\n\nOn February 17-18 1944, the United States Navy attacked the Japanese naval and air base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. The U.S. attack involved a combination of air strikes, surface ship actions, and submarine attacks over two days. In total the attack sank three Japanese light cruisers, four destroyers, three auxiliary cruisers, two submarine tenders, three other smaller warships, an aircraft transport and 32 merchant ships. Over 250 Japanese aircraft were destroyed. The U.S. lost twenty-five aircraft. A night time torpedo attack by a Japanese aircraft from either Rabaul or Saipan damaged the Intrepid and killed 11 of her crew, forcing her to return to Pearl Harbor. Allied forces isolated Truk as they continued their advance towards Japan by invading other Pacific islands such as Guam, Saipan, Palau, and Iwo Jima. Cut off, the Japanese forces on Truk and other central Pacific islands ran low on food and faced starvation before Japan surrendered in August 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6161;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Eniwetok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6161;We have lost the naval battle of Eniwetok!\n\nThe Battle of Eniwetok took place from 17 February 1944 to 23 February 1944 on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The invasion of Eniwetok followed the American success in the battle of Kwajalein to the southeast. Naval bombardment of Eniwetok began on 17 February, and the 22nd Marine Regiment landed on Engebi Island, on the north side of the atoll, on 18 February. The island was secured within six hours. There was only a short bombardment on 19 February before the 106th Infantry Regiment went ashore on Eniwetok Island. The Japanese soldiers had strong positions, and the Americans were stopped by heavy automatic fire. The island was not secured until 21 February. 37 Americans were killed and more than 800 Japanese defenders died. The mistake was not repeated on Parry Island, which was bombarded intensely before the 22nd Marines landed there and met only light resistance. The atoll's remaining islands were captured on 23 February. Eniwetok Atoll provided a forward base for the United States Navy for its later operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6162;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Tinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6162;We have lost the naval battle of Tinian!\n\nThe Battle of Tinian took place from 24 July 1944 to 1 August 1944. The 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions landed on 24 July 1944, supported by naval bombardment and artillery firing across the strait from Saipan. The island was secured in nine days of fighting. On July 31, the surviving Japanese launched a suicide charge. The battle saw the first use of napalm in the Pacific. Of the 120 tanks dropped during the operation, 25 contained the napalm mixture and the rest an oil-gasoline mixture. The Japanese lost 8,010. Only 313 Japanese were taken prisoner. American losses stood at 328 dead and 1,571 wounded. After the battle, Tinian became an important base for further Allied operations in the Pacific Campaign. Camps were built for 50,000 troops. Fifteen thousand Seabees turned the island into the busiest airfield of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6163;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Cabanatuan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6163;We have lost the naval battle of Cabanatuan!\n\nThe Raid at Cabanatuan took place on January 30, 1945 and was a rescue mission near Cabanatuan by United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas that resulted in the liberation of 516 prisoners of war from a Japanese POW camp. After the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the battle for Bataan, many prisoners were sent to the Cabanatuan prisoner camp. As the Japanese removed the majority of the prisoners from the camp to other areas, just over 500 American and other Allied POWs remained. In late January 1945, a group of over a hundred Rangers and Scouts and several hundred guerrillas travelled 48 km behind Japanese lines to reach the camp. In a thirty-minute coordinated attack, hundreds of Japanese troops were killed as the Americans suffered minimal casualties in rescuing the prisoners from the camp. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6164;Unsuccessful First Naval Battle of Savo Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6164;We have lost the first naval battle of Savo Island!\n\nThe First Battle of Savo Island took place on August 8–9, 1942 between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval forces. Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and his Japanese naval force of seven cruisers and one destroyer attacked the British forces’ five cruisers and seven destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley VC. Mikawa surprised and routed the Allied force, sinking one Australian and three American cruisers, while suffering only moderate damage in return. The remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force withdrew from the Solomon Islands, temporarily conceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6165;Unsuccessful Second Naval Battle of Savo Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6165;We have lost the second naval battle of Savo Island!\n\nThe Second Battle of Savo Island took place from October 11 to 12, 1942 and was a naval battle between the Imperial Japanese Navy and United States Navy. On October 11, a U.S force of four cruisers and five destroyers intercepted the Japanese force. Taking the Japanese by surprise, the U.S warships sank one of the cruisers and one of the destroyers, heavily damaged another cruiser and forced the rest of the warships to abandon their bombardment mission and retreat. One of the U.S destroyers was sunk and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. In the meantime, the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by the U.S force. Later on the morning of October 12, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist the retreating, damaged warships. Air attacks by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6166;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of Makassar Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6166;We have lost the naval battle of Makassar Strait!\n\nThe Battle of Makassar Strait took place on 4 February 1942. American, British and Dutch forces headed out for Makassar Strait in search of the Japanese invasion force, which was reported to be passing through the straits and was said to include three cruisers and 18 destroyers, escorting transports and other ships. Japanese planes attacked the Allied cruisers. The Marblehead sustained two direct hits which penetrated the deck, killed 15 crewmembers directly and destroyed the ship's ability to manoeuvre. Houston initially evaded bombs successfully, but suffered a severe hit during a final attack. A bomb hit the deck near the aft gun turret, and killed 48 crewmembers. The rear guns were rendered useless. Due to the threat from bombers, the Allied forces could not advance to Makassar Strait. The retreat of the strike force resulted in the Japanese taking control of Makassar Strait and thereby tightening their grip on the western part of the Dutch East Indies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6167;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Lofoten Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6167;We have lost the naval battle of the Lofoten Islands!\n\nThe British Armed forces raided the Lofoten Islands in Norway on 4 March 1941. Approximately 1,000 men of No. 3 and No. 4 Commando, 52 Norwegians of Norwegian Independent Company 1 and demolition teams from the 55th Field Squadron Royal Engineers conducted the raid. The force made an unopposed landing and generally continued to meet no opposition. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some 3,600 tonnes of oil and glycerine. Through naval gunfire and demolition parties, 18,000 tons of shipping was sunk. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an Enigma cypher machine and its codebooks. This enabled German naval codes to be read at Bletchley Park, providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations. The British returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 loyal Norwegian volunteers and a number of Quisling collaborators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6168;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Seychelles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6168;We have lost the naval battle of the Seychelles!\n\nThe battle was fought between the British heavy cruiser HMS Cornwall and the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin. The battle began when the Royal Navy sighted the Pinguin and challenged what they thought was a merchant freighter. Pinguin fired her main battery and at least one shell hit the Royal Navy warship, causing little damage but enough to force HMS Cornwall to seek repairs after the battle. The British responded and after receiving several hits at and below the water line, Pinguin began to sink and her crew abandoned their ship. Aboard the Pinguin were merchant sailors that had been taken captive by the Germans from over thirty different allied vessels. The Pinguin was just as much a prison as she was a warship. Only twenty-two of the 222 prisoners aboard the Pinguin survived. About 332 Germans were killed, sixty of who were rescued and later imprisoned. Only one British sailor was killed in the engagement. A total of 533 men lost their lives that day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6169;Unsuccessful Naval Battle of the Bismarck Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6169;We have lost the naval battle of the Bismarck Sea!\n\nThe Battle of the Bismarck Sea took place from 2 to 4 March 1943 and was a battle in which planes of the United States Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force attacked a Japanese convoy carrying troops to Lae, New Guinea. Most of the task force was destroyed, and Japanese troop losses were extremely high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6170;Unsuccessful Raid on Makin Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6170;We have lost at Makin Island!\n\nThe Makin Island Raid took place from August 17, 1942 to August 18, 1942 and was an attack by the United States Marine Corps on the Japanese military. Although the Marine Raiders succeeded in annihilating the Japanese garrison on the island, the raid failed to meet its other material objectives. No Japanese prisoners were taken, and no meaningful intelligence was collected. Also, no significant Japanese forces were diverted from the Solomon Islands area. In fact, because the raid highlighted the vulnerabilities to their garrisons in the Gilbert Islands, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and defensive preparations on the islands in the central Pacific, which may have caused heavier losses for U.S. forces during the battles of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns. However, the raid did succeed in its objectives of boosting morale and testing Raider tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6171;Unsuccessful Operation Jaywick;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6171;Operation Jaywick has been a failure!\n\nOperation Jaywick was a special operation undertaken in September 1943, when 14 Allied commandos from the Z Special Unit raided Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour, sinking seven ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6501;Siege of Warszawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6501;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nOn September 26 the general assault was started on all fronts of surrounded Warszawa. The attack was repelled and the German forces had to retreat to their initial positions. The following night the Polish forces managed to destroy several German outposts, especially the Polish positions in boroughs of Mokotów and Praga. On September 27 the German High Command organised yet another all-out assault that was yet again repelled with heavy casualties on both sides. The military situation of Warszawa was relatively good, and General Czuma was able to successfully defend the city for several weeks longer. The situation of the civilian inhabitants of Warszawa became increasingly tragic. Constant bombardment of civilian facilities, lack of food and medical supplies resulted in heavy casualties among the civilians. On September 27 a cease fire agreement was signed and all fighting halted. Soon afterwards Warszawa capitulated. On October 1 German units entered the city. The siege of Warszawa was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6502;Siege of Calais;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6502;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Calais was fought from May 23, 1940 to 26 May, 1940. The English 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, the 229th Anti-tank battery of the Royal Artillery and the Queen Victoria’s Rifles, all under Brigadier Claude Nicholson, defended Calais. The attackers were the 86th Rifle Regiment and the 69th Rifle Regiment under the command of Generalmajor Ferdinand Schaal. The defenders of Calais arrived in the city on 22 May. On the morning of 26 May, Calais Nord and the Citadel were pounded by artillery and by 200 German bombers. About mid-afternoon, the Germans finally crossed the bridges over the canal and advanced into Calais Nord. On the other side of the harbour, they captured the Gare Maritime. The citadel was surrounded. The Rifle Brigade was forced into a last stand around Bastion No. 1, north of the Gare Maritime. Nicholson himself surrendered in the citadel at 4 pm. German killed and wounded during the battle were not recorded, but probably amounted to several hundred, as a result of the fierce fighting over three days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6503;Siege of Lille;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6503;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Lille took place from 28 May 1940 through 31 May 1940 in the surroundings of the city of Lille. The siege involved 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army in a delaying action against seven German divisions which were attempting to cut off and destroy the Allied armies at Dunkirk. As a consequence of the continued French resistance, a number of Allied formations managed to escape to Dunkirk. During the battle the French counterattacked, even capturing the German General, Kühne, commander of the German 251st infantry division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6504;Siege of Bastogne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6504;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Bastogne took place from December 20 to December 27 and was an engagement between American and German forces at the Belgian town of Bastogne. The goal of the German offensive was the harbor at Antwerp. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the Ardennes mountain range converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. The siege lasted until the besieged American forces were relieved by elements of General Patton's Third Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6505;Siege of Odessa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6505;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Odessa took place from August 8 to October 16, 1941. Romanian forces and elements of the German Army’s 11th Army primarily conducted the siege. Due to the heavy resistance of the 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army, which was formed from the Coastal Group of the 9th Army, and the Black Sea Fleet forces in Odessa, it took the Romanian army 73 days of siege and four attempts to take the city, during which they suffered 93,000 casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6506;Siege of Breslau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6506;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Breslau took place from 13 February to 6 May 1945. German troops in Breslau were besieged by the Soviet forces, which encircled the city as part of the Lower Silesian Offensive Operation. The German garrison's surrender on 6 May was followed the next day by the surrender of all German forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6507;Siege of Budapest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6507;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Budapest took place from December 29, 1944 to February 13, 1945. The siege started when the Red Army and the Romanian Army encircled Budapest, defended by Hungarian and German troops. The siege ended when the city was unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945. The Soviet forces besieging the city were part of Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front. Formations that actually took part in the fighting appear to have included 53rd Army and 7th Guards Army, and portions of 3rd Ukrainian Front, including 46th Army. Arrayed against the Soviets was a collection of German Army, Waffen-SS, and Hungarian Army forces. The Siege of Budapest was one of the bloodiest sieges of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6508;Siege of Sevastopol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6508;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Sevastopol took place from 30 October 1941 to 4 July 1942 between German forces and those of the Red Army, the Black Sea Fleet and elements of the Red Air Force over the control for the main Soviet Black Sea Fleet naval base. On 30 October 1941, two infantry divisions and one motorized brigade were used in a rapid thrust launched towards Sevastopol. The Germans tried to burst into the city from the north, northeast and east, but were beaten back. Instead, the Germans encircled the city. After several attacks, bombings and counter-attacks, the Germans finally defeated the Soviets on 29 June 1942 and the city fell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6509;Siege of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6509;Our troops have been encircled!\n\nThe Siege of Malta was a military campaign in the Mediterranean Theatre and took place from 1940 to 1942. The fight for the control of the strategically important island of Malta pitted the air forces and navies of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. From Malta, British air and sea forces could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to the Axis forces in North Africa. Malta was one of the most intensively bombed areas during the war. The German Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica flew a total of 3,000 bombing raids over a period of two years. Axis plans were made for Operation Herkules, an amphibious invasion of the island supported by airborne forces, but these were never carried out. In the end, Allied convoys were able to supply and reinforce Malta, though at great cost. This played a major role in the eventual Allied victory in North Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6510;Siege of Leningrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6510;The Siege of Leningrad took place from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944. It was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and the most costly in terms of casualties. It caused the greatest destruction and the largest loss of life ever known in a modern city. Most of the palaces of the Tsars and other historic landmarks located outside the city's defensive perimeter were looted and then destroyed. A number of factories, schools, hospitals and other civil infrastructure were destroyed by air raids and long-range artillery bombardment. The siege resulted in the deaths of up to 1,500,000 soldiers and civilians and the evacuation of 1,400,000. Civilians in the city suffered from extreme starvation. In January-February of 1942 about 7000-10,000 citizens died every day, most of them from hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6511;Siege of Lwów;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6511;The Siege of Lwów was a battle for the control over the Polish city of Lwów between the Polish Army, the invading Wehrmacht and the Red Army. Soviet armoured units were pushed back after a short fight. The Soviet forces completed the encirclement of the city and joined up with the German army besieging Lwów from the west. The same day the German commander sent his envoy and demanded that the city be surrendered to Germany. When the Polish envoy replied that he had no intention of signing such a document, he was informed that the general assault was ordered on September 21 and that the city would most surely be taken. However, on September 20 the Germans left their positions to the north and south of the city, and were replaced with Soviet soldiers. On September 22, 1939, the act of surrender was signed in the suburb of Winniki.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6512;Siege of Meiktila;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6512;The Siege of Meiktila occurred near the end of the Burma Campaign. The defenders were the bulk of Japanese 168 Regiment from the 49th Division, and anti-aircraft and line of communication troops, totalling about 4,000. On 28 February, the 17th Division attacked Meiktila from all sides, supported by massed artillery and air strikes. The town fell in less than four days. Although the Japanese apparently had plenty of artillery, they were unable to concentrate their fire sufficiently to stop any single attacking brigade. On 28 March, Lieutenant General Shinichi Tanaka, Kimura's Chief of Staff, conferred with Honda at Thirty-third Army HQ. Honda's staff told him that the army had destroyed about 50 tanks, half the number of tanks in Meiktila. In doing so, the army had suffered 2,500 casualties and lost 50 guns, and had only 20 artillery pieces left. Tanaka accepted the responsibility of ordering Honda's army to break off the siege of Meiktila.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6513;Siege of Stalingrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6513;Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad. The battle took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as one of the turning points of the war. The German offensive to capture Stalingrad proceeded rapidly in the late summer of 1942, supported by Luftwaffe bombing which reduced much of the city to rubble. But the Wehrmacht was unable to dislodge the last Soviet defenders, who clung tenaciously to the west bank of the Volga River as the weather turned rainy and cold. In November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack on the exposed flanks of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. The weakly held German flanks collapsed and the German 6th Army was cut off and surrounded inside Stalingrad. By early February 1943, German resistance in Stalingrad had ceased, and the surrounded 6th Army had been destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6514;Siege of Myitkyina;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6514;The Siege of Myitkyina took place from 17 May to 3 August 1944. American forces captured the airfield at Myitkyina. The siege was not very well directed and cost the allies many men. The long siege also resulted in heavy Japanese losses. When the airfield was captured, the Japanese in the town at first intended to fight a delaying action only, aided by the monsoon rains. On 10 June, Major General Genzo Mizukami, who had been sent with reinforcements and placed in charge of the garrison, was ordered personally to ‘Defend Myitkyina to the death’. Further resistance appeared hopeless by the end of July. Mizukami evacuated the survivors of the garrison before fulfilling the letter of his orders by taking his own life inside the defended perimeter. Myitkyina was finally captured on 3 August.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6515;Siege of Brest-Litovsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6515;The Siege of Brest-Litovsk took place between 14 and 17 September 1939, near the town of Brest-Litovsk. The Polish forces consisted of a small, improvised force which defended the city of Brest and its ancient fortress. The fortress occupied a pivotal position on the Polish lines and its defence could prevent German forces from crossing the Polesia area into Lesser Poland and Galicia to the south. After three days of heavy fighting, the Polish General Plisowski ordered part of his forces to retreat and regroup on the other side of the river and southwards. The evacuation was completed by the early morning of 17 September when the last unit crossing the bridge blew it up to hinder the Germans. An hour later elements of the German 76th infantry regiment entered the fortress - almost unopposed. The German forces managed to take the fortress and then handed it over to the Red Army. The battle of Brest-Litovsk was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6516;Siege of Le Havre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6516;Operation Astonia was a battle fought from 10 September 1944 to 12 September 1944. The Allied objective of the operation was the capture of the German-held port of Le Havre. The assault began on 10 September, with naval vessels engaging the coastal batteries defending the port and RAF bombers dropping approximately 5,000 tons of bombs. On the third day of the assault the town centre was finally cleared. The German garrison commander officially surrendered the port and 12,000 German troops were captured and interned as prisoners of war. The port had been successfully captured with few military casualties. The civilian damage, however, was severe. The artillery and air assaults had destroyed 350 ships and 18 kilometres of docks, as well as 15,000 buildings, significantly reducing the usefulness of Le Havre as a supply port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6517;Siege of Poznan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6517;Poznan lay on the main route between Warszawa and Berlin, and in German hands, was a serious obstacle to Soviet resupply efforts between Poznan and Berlin. By January 25, the Soviet 8th Guards Army had arrived and began a systematic reduction of the fortress. In bitter combat that saw the outlying forts reduced and city blocks seized, the Soviets succeeded in pushing the German defenders towards the city center and the citadel. By the beginning of February 1945, most of the city had been liberated, and by February 12th, the Germans held only the imposing citadel. The final Soviet assault on the citadel started on February 18. Having built an assault bridge, Red Army tanks and assault guns crossed into the main grounds of the citadel early on February 22, commencing the final struggle for the old fortress. That evening, Generalmajor Mattern surrendered the remaining 12,000 German troops to General Chuikov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6518;Siege of Wien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6518;The Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front launched the Wien Offensive in order to capture Wien. The offensive lasted from April 2 to April 13, 1945. The armies of the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front surrounded, besieged, and attacked the city. By April 15,1945, armies of the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front pushed further into Austria. The completely exhausted remnants of what had been the 6th SS Panzer Army were forced to flee to the area between Wien and Linz. Some of Wien's finest buildings lay in ruins after the battle. There was no water, electricity, or gas - and bands of people, both foreigners and Austrians, plundered and assaulted the hapless residents in the absence of a police force. While the Soviet assault forces generally behaved well, the second wave of Soviet troops to arrive in the city were badly disciplined, looting and raping in a several-week orgy of violence that has been compared to the worst aspects of the Thirty Years War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6519;Siege of Kohima;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6519;The Siege of Kohima was the turning point of the Japanese U Go offensive into India in 1944. The battle was fought from 4 April to 22 June 1944 around the town of Kohima in northeast India. The battle took place in three stages. From 3 April to 16 April, the Japanese attempted to capture Kohima ridge, a feature that dominated the road by which the major British and Indian troops at Imphal were supplied. By mid-April, the small British force at Kohima was relieved, and from 18 April to 13 May, British and Indian reinforcements counter-attacked to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured. The Japanese abandoned the ridge at this point but continued to block the Kohima-Imphal road. From May 16 to 22 June, the British and Indian troops pursued the retreating Japanese and reopened the road. The battle ended on 22 June when British and Indian troops from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109, ending the siege of Imphal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6520;Siege of La Rochelle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6520;The Allied siege of La Rochelle occurred in 1944–45, when Allied troops invaded France. La Rochelle was an important German base on the Atlantic, especially a major submarine base from where U-Boat campaigns were launched. Until the end of the war, La Rochelle was, with other harbors such as Royan or Saint-Nazaire, one of the remaining 'Atlantic pockets' occupied by the Germans, which had been bypassed by the main thrust of the Allied invasion. On the North Sea, Dunkirk was similarly bypassed. The city was only liberated at the very end of the war, nine months after the Liberation of Paris, after the general German capitulation on 8 May 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6521;Falaise Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6521;The battle of the Falaise Pocket, fought during the Second World War from 12–21 August 1944, was the decisive engagement of the Battle of Normandy. The battle resulted in the destruction of the bulk of Germany's forces west of the River Seine, and opened the way to Paris and the German border. Operation Lüttich, a German counterattack, was a disaster that merely served to drive the Germans deeper into the Allied lines, leaving them in a highly dangerous position. The Germans fought hard to keep an escape route open, although their withdrawal did not begin until 17 August. By the evening of 21 August the pocket was closed for the last time, with around 50,000 Germans still trapped inside. Although it is estimated that significant numbers managed to escape, German losses in both men and materiel were huge, and the Allies had achieved a decisive victory. Two days later Paris was liberated, and by 30 August the last German remnants had retreated across the Seine, effectively ending Operation Overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6522;Ruhr Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6522;The Ruhr Pocket was a battle of encirclement that took place in late March and early April 1945, near the end of World War II, in the Ruhr Area of Germany. It was, for all intents and purposes, the final dagger in Nazi Germany's war effort, as more than 300,000 troops were taken prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6523;Colmar Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6523;Located in Alsace in eastern France, the Colmar Pocket was the site of a three-week operation between 20 January and 9 February 1945, where the French First Army and the U.S. XXI Corps overwhelmed German Nineteenth Army resistance in bitter, extremely cold winter fighting over terrain that offered practically no cover for attacking forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6524;Kholm Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6524;The Toropets–Kholm Offensive was a military operation conducted south of Lake Ilmen by the Red Army from 9 January to 6 February 1942. The operation contributed to the formation of the Kholm Pocket, the encirclement of the Wehrmacht's II Army Corps in the Demjansk Pocket, and the destruction of the 189th Infantry Regiment near Andreapol. The initial penetration of the 3rd and 4th Shock Armies was very successful. The failure to predict this attack, coupled with multiple demands on the German reserves, gave the Soviet Front command an opening that it exploited to the utmost, driving deep into the German rear. The drive of the Soviet forces was so strong that the defending German formation, 123rd Infantry Division had its forward two regiments overrun. The Soviet aim of encircling Army Group Centre was not achieved, but the attack by the two Shock Armies created a deep bend in the German frontline that was to become a major concern for the German army group commands over the year of 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6525;Demjansk Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6525;The Demjansk Pocket was the name given to the encirclement of German troops by the Red Army around Demjansk, south of Leningrad. The pocket existed mainly from 8 February until 21 April 1942. The encirclement began as the Demyansk Offensive Operation, the first phase being carried out between 7 January 1942 and 20 May 1942. The intention was to sever the link between the German Demyansk positions and the Staraya Russa railway. On 8 January 1942, a new offensive called the Rzhev-Vyazma Strategic Offensive Operation started. This incorporated the previous Front's planning into the Toropets-Kholm Offensive Operation between 9 January 1942 and 6 February 1942 which formed the southern pincer of the attack that encircled the German 16th Army's IInd, and parts of the Xth Army Corps during winter 1941/1942. Trapped in the pocket were a total of about 90,000 German troops and around 10,000 auxiliaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6526;Korsun-Shevchenkovskyy Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6526;The Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the Battle of the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket which took place from 24 January to 16 February, 1944. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts trapped German forces of Army Group South in a pocket near the Dnieper river. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket. German units inside the cauldron broke out in coordination with a relief attempt by other German forces. On 18 January, Manstein was proven prescient when the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts attacked the edges of the salient and surrounded the two German corps. The link-up on 28 January of 20th Guards Tank Brigade with 6th Guards Tank Army of the First Ukrainian Front at the village of Zvenyhorodka completed the encirclement and created the cauldron that became known as the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket. Trapped in the pocket were fewer than 60,000 men, a total of six German divisions at approximately 55% of their authorized strength, along with a number of smaller combat units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6527;Praha Pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6527;The Praha Offensive was the last major Soviet operation of World War II in Europe. The offensive, and the battle for Praha, was fought on the Eastern Front from 6 May to 11 May 1945. This battle for the city is particularly noteworthy in that it ended after the Third Reich capitulated on 8 May 1945. The city of Praha was ultimately liberated by the USSR during the Praha Offensive. All of the German troops of Army Group Centre were killed or captured. The capitulation of Army Group Centre was nine days after the fall of Berlin and three days after Victory in Europe Day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6528;Siege of Memel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6528;The Siege of Memel took place in late 1944. The offensive led to a three-month siege against German forces in a small bridgehead in the town and its port. Soviet forces settled down to a blockade of the German troops that had withdrawn into Memel. The blockade, and defence, was maintained through November, December, and much of January, during which period the remaining civilians who had fled into the town, and military wounded, were evacuated by sea. The town was finally abandoned on January 27, 1945. The success of the Soviet East Prussian Offensive to the south made the position of the bridgehead untenable, and it was decided to withdraw the XXVIII Corps from the town into Samland to assist in the defence there. The remaining troops of the 95th and 58th Infantry Divisions were evacuated to the Curonian Spit, where the 58th Division acted as a rearguard for the withdrawal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6529;Siege of Königsberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6529;The Siege of Königsberg was one of the last operations of the East Prussian Offensive. In four days of violent urban warfare, Soviet forces of the 3rd Belorussian Front captured the city of Königsberg. The siege started in late January 1945 when the Soviets initially surrounded the city. There was heavy fighting for the overland connection between Königsberg and the port of Pillau, but by March 1945 Königsberg was hundreds of kilometres behind the main front line. The battle finished when the German garrison surrendered to the Soviets on 9 April after a three day assault made their position untenable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6530;Siege of Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6530;On 20 April, Soviet artillery of the 1st Belorussian Front began to shell the centre of Berlin and did not stop until the city surrendered. The Soviet plan was to encircle Berlin first and then envelop the IX Army. On 23 April, the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front tightened the encirclement. By 24 April elements of 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. Within the next day, the Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated with leading Soviet units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of the day there was no prospect that the German defence of the city could do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the city by the Soviets as the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans outside the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6531;Siege of Imphal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6531;The Battle of Imphal took place in the region around the city of Imphal, the capital of the state of Manipur in northeast India from March until July 1944. Japanese armies attempted to destroy the Allied forces at Imphal and invade India, but were driven back into Burma with heavy losses. Together with the simultaneous Battle of Kohima on the road by which the encircled Allied forces at Imphal were relieved, the battle was the turning point of the Burma Campaign. Many historians consider it to be the biggest Japanese defeat of the war to be inflicted by British and Commonwealth forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6532;Siege of Dunkerque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6532;The Siege of Dunkerque took place from September 1944 to May 1945. Units of the Second Canadian Division surrounded the heavily fortified city and port of Dunkerque. German units withstood initial probing attacks and, as the opening of the port of Antwerp became a higher priority, Dunkerque was ‘masked’ by Allied troops, notably the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade and left to the rear of the Canadian Army. The garrison remained in Dunkerque until the general German surrender in May 1945, denying the Allies the use of the port, whose facilities had been demolished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6533;Siege of Kyiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6533;The Battle of Kiev took place from August 23, 1941 to September 26, 1941 and was the German name for an operation that resulted in a very large encirclement of Soviet troops in the vicinity of Kiev. It is considered the largest encirclement of troops in history. Nearly the entire Southwestern Front of the Red Army was encircled with the Germans claiming 665,000 captured. The Kiev disaster was an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army. On 1 September the Southwestern Front numbered 752-760,000 troops, 3,923 guns and mortars, 114 tanks and 167 combat aircraft. The encirclement trapped 452,700 troops, 2,642 guns and mortars and 64 tanks, of which scarcely 15,000 escaped from the encirclement by 2 October. Overall, the Southwestern Front suffered 700,544 casualties, including 616,304 killed, captured, or missing during the month-long Battle of Kiev. As a result, four Soviet field armies consisting of 43 divisions virtually ceased to exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME6702;Texel Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6702;The soldiers and citizens of Texel are in uproar!\n\nThe Georgian Uprising on Texel took place from 5 April 1945 to 20 May 1945. The 882nd Infantry Battalion Königin Tamara of the Georgian Legion of the German Army was made up of 800 Georgians and 400 Germans. The men of the rebellious battalion were Red Army soldiers from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic captured on the Eastern front. The men had chosen to serve the Germans instead of remaining in the POW camps, which would mean almost certain death and so the battalion was formed. The Georgians rose up and gained control of nearly the entire island on 5 April 1945. Approximately four hundred German soldiers were killed in the initial uprising. The Georgians failed to secure the naval batteries on the coasts of the island. Canadian troops landed unopposed on Texel on 20 May 1945, effectively liberating the island. Over a two-day period the Canadians disarmed 1,535 Germans. Soviet SMERSH forces arrived on Texel and took charge of 228 Georgians still alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6703;Four Days of Napoli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6703;Rebels are wreaking havoc in Italy!\n\nThe Four days of Napoli took place from 27 to 30 September 1943 and it refers to the popular uprising in the Italian city of Napoli against the German forces occupying the city. The townsfolk and the Italian Resistance forced out the occupiers before the arrival of the first Allied forces in Napoli on 1 October, and for these actions the city was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6704;Warszawa Ghetto Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6704;Rebels are wreaking havoc in Poland!\n\nThe Warszawa Ghetto Uprising took place from January 18, 1943 to May 16, 1943. In 1940, the German Nazis began concentrating Poland's population of over three million Jews into a number of extremely crowded ghettos located in large Polish cities. The Nazi forces conducted a lot of deportations between July 23 and September 21, 1942. By the end of 1942 it became known to Ghetto inhabitants that the deportations were part of an extermination process. Many of the remaining Jews decided to resist. On January 18 1943, the Germans began their second deportation of the Jews, which led to the first instance of armed insurgency within the ghetto. The deportation was halted and only 5,000 Jews were removed instead of the planned 8,000. Two resistance organizations took control of the Ghetto but, ultimately, the efforts of the Jewish resistance fighters proved insufficient against the German forces. The suppression of the uprising officially ended on May 16, 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6705;Warszawa Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6705;The citizens of Warszawa are in uproar!\n\nThe Warszawa Uprising took place from 1 August to 2 October 1944 and was a struggle by the Polish resistance movement organization Polish Home Army to liberate Warszawa from Nazi German occupation. The Uprising began as the Soviet Army approached Warszawa. The main Polish objectives were to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers. By 16 September, Soviet forces had reached a point a few hundred meters from the Polish positions but they made no further headway during the Uprising, leading to allegations that the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had wanted the insurrection to fail so that the Soviet occupation of Poland would be uncontested. About 16,000 Polish insurgents were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 civilians died, mostly from mass murders conducted by troops fighting on the German side. German casualties totalled over 16,000 soldiers killed and 9,000 wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME6706;June Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6706;Rebels are wreaking havoc in Lithuania!\n\nThe June Uprising took place in June 1941. About one year earlier, on June 15 1940, the Red Army had invaded Lithuania and the unpopular Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was soon established. Political repression and terror were used to silence its critics and suppress any resistance. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22 1941, a diverse segment of the Lithuanian population rose up against the Soviet regime, declared renewed independence, and formed the short-lived Provisional Government. Two of the major Lithuanian cities fell into the hands of the rebels before the arrival of the Wehrmacht. The German Army took control of the whole of Lithuania within a week. The Nazis steadily replaced Lithuanian institutions with their own administration. The Reichskommissariat Ostland was established at the end of July 1941. Deprived of any real power, the Provisional Government self-disbanded on August 5.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC6707;Rebels are wreaking havoc in Yugoslavia!\n\nThe Yugoslav Front was fought in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II between the Yugoslav resistance forces and the Axis powers. In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was quickly overrun by Axis forces and partitioned between Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and client regimes in Croatia and Serbia. The royalist guerrilla group named Chetniks allied with the Axis forces against the communist-led guerrilla group named Partisans, receiving increasing amounts of logistical assistance, eventually losing Allied support. Despite setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, gaining recognition from the Western Allies and laying the foundations for the post-war Yugoslav state. With support in logistics, equipment, training, and air power from the Western Allies, and Soviet ground troups in the Belgrade Offensive, the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and the border regions of Italy and Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC6800;The Yellow River is flooding Zhengzhou! Those devious Chinese blew up the dikes retaining the river and now it threatens to drown us all!\n\nIn 1938, during the war with Japan, the retreating Chinese Nationalist Army blew up the dikes retaining the Yellow River about 32 km northeast of Zhengzhou, flooding a vast area. At about the same time, in their drive to relocate industry to the interior far from the invading Japanese, the Chinese transferred all the local plants to the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7000;Forts at the Maginot line took great damage when Germany invaded France and they were almost entirely destroyed. The few still remaining are in dire need of repairs before they can be used for defensive warfare again.\n\nThe Maginot Line was a line of concrete fortifications, tank obstacles, artillery casemates, machine gun posts, and other defences, which France constructed along its borders with Germany and Italy. The forts were built for several purposes: to avoid a surprise attack and to give alarm, to cover the mobilization of the French Army, to be used as a basis for a counter-offensive and to hold the enemy while the main army could be brought up to reinforce the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
