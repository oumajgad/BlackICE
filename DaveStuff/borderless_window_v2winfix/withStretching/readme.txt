Fixes mouse cursor in windowed mode, and allows borderless fullscreen for a few paradox games.
Only works with Victoria 2, HoI3 (4.02, and 3.05), March of the Eagles, Sengoku, EU3, EU:Rome (steam version and GOG)
Only tested with steam versions, except Rome (tested good with GOG version as well as Steam.)

To enable windowed mode edit My Documents\Paradox Interactive\[Game Name]\settings.txt
or [Steam Dir]\SteamApps\common\[Game Name]\settings.txt
and set fullScreen = no

Drop dinput8.dll into the game directory.
To disable borderless windowed, run the game once with this enabled then edit My Documents\Paradox Interactive\v2winfix.ini

ok bye
