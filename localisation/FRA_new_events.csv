EVTNAME33301;Formation of the 1ère Division d'Infanterie Marocaine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33301;1ère Division d'Infanterie Marocaine (colonial infantry from Morocco) was set up at the end of October 1939 upon active regiments stationed in Morocco. It was then transferred to the Metropolitan area and assigned under the 4ème Corps d'Armée (1ère Armée). Its initial commander was general Sylvestre Audet, rapidly replaced by general Albert Mellier when Audet took command of the expeditionary force sent to Norway. 1ère DM participated in the action against German advancing armored forces at Gembloux and Lille before withdrawing to Dunkerque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33302;Formation of the 9ème Division d'Infanterie Coloniale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33302;9ème Division d'Infanterie Coloniale (colonial infantry) was set up in June 1940 and put under command of general Marcel Pellet when the Battle of France ended. It was then reformed in July 1943 by Free France and belonged to the First French Army of general Jean de Lattre de Tassigny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33303;Formation of the 40ème Division d'Infanterie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33303;40ème Division d'Infanterie was set up on May 30th, 1940 by assembling the remnants of two light infantry brigades sent to Norway (1ère DLCh, 2ème DLCh). Despite its name, it was a mountain infantry division. It was placed under the command of general Maurice Durand, former commander of the 2ème DLCh, and assigned to the General High Command as a reserve unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33304;Formation of the 44ème Division d'Infanterie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33304;44ème Division d'Infanterie was set up on March 1st, 1940. Despite its name, most of its regiments were mountain infantry. It was placed under the command of general Robert Boissau and assigned to the 5ème Armée.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33305;French Mobilisation - Type B reserve divisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33305;French Army started its mobilisation from August 21st to September 3rd, 1939. From 20 active divisions, it rose to 86 divisions, including new formations and reserve units. Mobilisation happened in three stages:\n\nFirst, active divisions were sent to the frontier to counter a possible attack, allowing the reserve divisions to be set up.\nThen, mobilisation centers started to form Type A reserve divisions, by duplicating active divisions. These units have half their strength formed by reservists aged from 20 to 40 years old. Equipment was very similar to active divisions.\nLast, mobilisation centers started to form Type B reserve divisions.\nType B reserve divisions were created from scratch with reservists from 40 to 48 years old. They had a very low percentage of officers from the active army and were equipped with outdated armament, lacking AT-guns. These divisions were not at full strength (80-85%) and were assigned to garrison, building, or farming duties. Although they were not designed to fight on front line, Type B reserve divisions were finally thrown into combat because of the lack of troops to stop German penetrations.\n\n\nÂ§RNote for player: Type A reserve divisions are already in the starting OOB. This event will fire Type B reserve divisions in 2 stages.Â§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33306;French Type-B reserve divisions for TONE;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33306;16 Type-B reserve divisions were assigned to Théâtre d'Opérations du Nord-Est (TONE - North East Theatre of Operations) against Germany. All were infantry divisions with a standard metropolitan composition.\n\n Â§RNote for player: you will receive these divisions on map, at 20% strength, no organisation and will have to reinforce and attach them to HQs.Â§B\n 51ème DI > 24ème Corps d'Armée (3ème Armée)\n 52ème DI > 30ème Corps d'Armée (4ème Armée)\n 53ème DI > 9ème Armée\n 54ème DI > 13ème Corps d'Armée (8ème Armée)\n 55ème DI > 10ème Corps d'Armée (2ème Armée)\n 56ème DI > Corps d'Armée colonial (3ème Armée)\n 57ème DI > 45ème CAF (6ème Armée)\n 58ème DI > 42ème CAF (3ème Armée)\n 60ème DI > 7ème Armée\n 61ème DI > 41ème CAF (9ème Armée)\n 62ème DI > 45ème CAF (6ème Armée)\n 67ème DI > 44ème CAF (8ème Armée)\n 68ème DI > attached to Amiral Nord (Marine HQ in Dunkerque)\n 70ème DI > 12ème Corps d'Armée (5ème Armée)\n 71ème DI > 2ème Armée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33307;French Type-B reserve divisions for TOSE;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33307;Type-B reserve divisions were assigned to Théâtre d'Opérations du Sud-Est (TOSE - South East Theatre of Operations) against a possible Italian attack through the Alps. All were mountain divisions with a standard metropolitan composition.\n\nÂ§RNote for player: you will receive these divisions on map, at 20% strength, no organisation and will have to reinforce and attach them to HQs.Â§B\n64ème DIAlp > 14th Army Corps (Army of the Alps)\n65ème DIAlp > 15th Army Corps (Army of the Alps)\n66ème DIAlp > 14th Army Corps (Army of the Alps);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33308;Formation of Divisions Légères de Cavalerie (DLC - Cavalry Light Divisions);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33308;In November 1939, the French High Command decided to transform its three remaining Cavalry Divisions into five lighter divisions (Divisions Légères de Cavalerie) in order to delay enemy advancing troops. Former Cavalry Divisions from type 1932, partially motorised, consisted of two cavalry brigades each with two regiments, and were supported by motorised troops: one artillery regiment, one motorised infantry battalion, and one armored car regiment.\nAs a result of this composition, different maneuvre speeds (8 km/h and 30 km/h respectively) and supply requirements made the 'Divisions de Cavalerie' unwieldy units. They were derisively nicknamed 'pétrole-picotin' (oil and oats) or 'crottin et cambouis' (horse dung and dirty grease) divisions.\nThe newly formed divisions (early February 1940) were supposed to be more efficient, organized into two different parts grouping cavalry elements on one side and motorised troops on the other. Each division had a theoretical total of 16 Panhard 178 armored cars, 22 Renault 35-ZT armored cars and 16 H35 light support tanks.\n\n1ère Division de Cavalerie was transformed into 1ère DLC and 1ère Brigade de Cavalerie\n2ème Division de Cavalerie was transformed into 2ème DLC and 4ème DLC\n3ème Division de Cavalerie was transformed into 3ème DLC and 5ème DLC\nOn March 1940, remaining cavalry regiments stationed in Africa were merged to form the 6ème DLC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33309;Formation of the 1ère Division Légère de Cavalerie (DLC);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33309;1ère DLC formed the structure of the 1ère Division de Cavalerie (DC) on February 10th, 1940. It was assigned to 9ème Armée in Saint-Mihiel and placed under the command of general Jacques Marie Toussaint d'Arras, commander of the former division.\nRemaining troops were used to create the 1ère Brigade de Cavalerie assigned to the 2ème Armée.\nIn May 1940, the 1ère DLC participated in the delaying actions in the Ardenne. After 10 days of combat, the division was almost destroyed and its remnants are used to form the 4ème DLM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33310;Formation of 2ème DLC and 4ème DLC;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33310;Both divisions were established from the former 2ème Division de Cavalerie on February 10th, 1940. The 2ème DLC was formed in Montmédy, under the command of general André Berniquet and assigned to the 2ème Armée. The division also participated in the delaying maneuver in the Ardenne, fighting in Sedan. It was then involved in De Gaulleâ€™s counterattack on Abbeville. Placed in a defensive stance along the Somme, the division was trapped and destroyed near Saint-Valéry-de-Caux.\nThe 4ème DLC was formed in Vitry-le-FranÃ§ois and assigned to the 9ème Armée, like the 1ère DLC. Its commander was general Paul Louis Arthur Barbe, KIA on May 15th, 1940. In June, as the division was almost destroyed, its remnants were used to form the 7ème DLM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33311;Formation of 3ème DLC and 5ème DLC;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33311;Both divisions were created from the former 3ème Division de Cavalerie on February 10th, 1940. 3ème DLC was formed in Longwy under the command of general Robert Petiet and assigned to the 3ème Armée. The division was assigned to delaying actions in Luxembourg, setting up defenses along the Somme and the Seine.\n5ème DLC was formed in Saint Menehould on February 25th, 1940 and attached to the 2ème Armée. Its commander was general Marie Jacques Henri Chanoine and fought alongside the 2ème DLC and 1ère Brigade de Cavalerie until its complete destruction near Saint-Valéry-de-Caux.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33312;Formation of 6ème Division Legere de Cavalerie in North Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33312;6ème DLC was created on March 1st, 1940 in Algeria by assembling various cavalry regiments stationed there. This division was commanded by general Denis Marie Joseph Félix Clouet de Pesruches and assigned in June to the South Tunisian Front to prevent an attack from Italian forces stationed in Libya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33313;Formation of Divisions Légères Mécaniques (DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33313;The DLM were the first French armored units to be constituted, coming from the army's cavalry branch. Motorisation of cavalry units started in the mid-thirties under the authority of Jean Flavigny, director of Cavalry and Logistics between 1932 and 1936. The 1ère Division Légère Mécanique was set up in July 1935 in Reims from the former 4ème Division de Cavalerie and placed under the command of general Francois Picard.\nThis new type of division was composed of two armored brigades - one made of two tank regiments, the second made of motorised elements (infantry, recon, artillery) - and various support units. It totalized 96 Somua S-35 medium tanks, 94 Hotchkiss H-35/H39 light tanks, 48 Panhard AMD 178 and 69 Renault 35-ZT armored cars. Each division was composed of 10,400 men and the adjective 'light' only meant the ability of fast movement. For all these reasons, the DLM divisions were very close in strength and purpose to their German counterpart, the early Panzerdivisionen.\n\nThe 2ème Division Légère Mécanique was created before war in Lyon from the former 5ème Division de Cavalerie.\nThe 3ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in February 1940.\nThe 4ème Division Légère Mécanique was organized in early June 1940 from the remnants of the 1ère DLC.\nThe 7ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in early June 1940 from the remnants of the 4ème DLC.\nPlans to convert all DLC into DLM equipped with Somua-S35 medium tanks were interrupted by the fate of war in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33314;Formation of 2ème Division Légère Mécanique (2ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33314;The 2ème Division Légère Mécanique was organized in Lyon in 1937 upon the basis of the former 5ème Division de Cavalerie. Its first commander was Félix René Altmayer until he was replaced by general Gabriel Bougrain in September, 1939.\nThe 2ème DLM was assigned to Cavalry Corps alongside the 3ème DLM. Between the 12th and 14th of May, René Prioux's cavalry corps faced Erich Hoepner's XVI. Armee-Korps (mot.) made of 3. Panzerdivision and 4. Panzerdivision in Hannut, Belgium. It was the largest tank battle of the campaign and, at this time, the largest clash of tanks in armored warfare history. Despite heavy losses (half inflicted by the Luftwaffe), the 2ème DLM succeeded in delaying the German advance, destroying many tanks. It was then assigned to cover the retreat of the French 1ère Armée before being encircled in the Dunkerque Pocket.\nRemnants of the 2ème DLM who were rescued from Dunkerque were used to reform the division, south of Paris in Dourdan, and assigned to the newly formed 10ème Armée. The 2ème DLM fought in a defensive stance until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33315;Formation of 3ème Division Légère Mécanique (3ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33315;The 3ème Division Légère Mécanique was assembled in Saint-Quentin in February 1940 under the command of general Jean Léon Albert Langlois, former chief of staff of the 2ème Armée. In early March, the division was assigned to René Prioux's Cavalry Corps, replacing the 1ère DLM sent to the 7ème Armée.\nThe division also took heavy losses in the tank battle of Hannut and met the same fate as its sister division, 2ème DLM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33316;Formation of 4ème Division Légère Mécanique(4ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33316;The 4ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be created in July 1940 by transforming the former 1ère DLC. Due to the rapid advance of German forces, the formation of this division was interrupted to send all armored forces to the front. Half of its equipment was sent to the newly formed 4ème Division Cuirassée (DCR) under command of general Charles de Gaulle.\nThe other part was assembled as a 'Groupement mécanique de marche' under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Pierre de Langle de Cary and sent to the 7th Army.\n\nÂ§RHere you have the possibility to create the full division or go historical.Â§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33317;Formation of 7ème Division Légère Mécanique (7ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33317;The 7ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be set up in July 1940 by transformation of the former 4ème Division Légère de Cavalerie. This unit was never formed because of the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33318;Formation of 8ème Division Légère Mécanique (8ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33318;The 8ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be set up in August 1940 by transforming the 5ème Division Légère de Cavalerie. This unit was never formed, due to the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33319;Formation of 5ème Division Légère Mécanique (5ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33319;The 5ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be created by transforming the 2ème Division Légère de Cavalerie. This unit was never formed, due to the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33320;Formation of 6ème Division Légère Mécanique (6ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33320;The 6ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be created by transforming the 3ème Division Légère de Cavalerie. This unit was never formed, due to the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33321;Send armored reinforcements to Tunisia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33321;In April 1938, French High Command started to consider the threat of Italian forces in Libya and decided to send armored reinforcements to the Front Sud Tunisien. The Groupe de Bataillons de Chars (GBC) 521 consisted of three battalions (61st, 65th, 67th) totaling 135 Renault D1 infantry support tanks.\nAlthough these tanks were already outdated, they saw combat during Operation Torch (1942) and later in the Allied campaign against Axis forces in Tunisia (1943).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33322;Formation of the 'Groupement tactique d'expérience';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33322;Alongside the newly formed DLM, French High command ordered the formation of an experimental unit in Nancy, an amalgam of different detached units assembled to work on a new concept of tank utilisation. This group was composed of 4 heavy tanks battalions from various units, equipped with Renault B1 and B1 Bis, two batallions of motorised infantry and an all-terrain motorised artillery regiment with 105 mm guns.\nThis experience and witnessing the effectiveness of German panzers in the Polish Campaign encouraged General Gamelin to order the formation of two French armored brigades from this tactical group in September 1939. These two armored brigades were soon transformed into the first French armored divisions: 1ère et 2ème Divisions Cuirassées de Réserve (DCR).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33323;Formation of the 1ère Division Cuirassee de Réserve (1ère DCR - armored division);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33323;The 1ère DCR was formed on January 16th, 1940 in Châlons from the 1ère Brigade Cuirassée. Its initial commander was general Marie Germain Christian Bruneau and the division was attached to the 1ère Armée (general Blanchard). It was the most powerful French army unit when it entered Belgium on May 10th, 1940 with some 90 Hotchkiss H-35 light tanks and 70 B1-Bis heavy tanks. Slowed by refugees and lack of fuel, the 1ère DCR missed the opportunity to smash Erwin Rommel and his 7. Panzerdivision on May 14th when it was vunerable. During the battle of Flavion, south of Charleroi (May 15th), the division was engaged by the 5. and 7. Panzerdivisions, suffering heavy losses (100 tanks) but managing to knock out between 60 to 100 German tanks and 20 armored cars.\nMost of the French losses were provocated by lack of fuel, communications, recon capacities, and inadequate anti-aircraft guns. General Bruneau and its staff were captured on May 18th near Bantouzelle.\nThe division was reinforced in late May and placed under the command of general Marie Joseph Edmond Welvert. The 1ère DCR covered the retreat of the 7ème Armée and was disbanded after the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33324;Formation of the 2ème Division Cuirassée de Réserve (2ème DCR);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33324;The 2ème DCR was created on January 16th, 1940 like the 1ère DCR. It was assigned to the 1ère Armée and then to the 1er Groupement Cuirassé, a GHQ reserve force. Thought to engage enemy tank formations and motorised units, the 2ème DCR was thrown against German troops piercing the front at Dinant. Facing Guderianâ€™s XIX. Armee Korps, general Albert Charles Emile Buche engaged its tanks in small formations because not all of the division's forces had been transferred to the front in time. One week later, the 2ème DCR had ceased to exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33325;Formation of the 3ème Division Cuirassée de Réserve (3ème DCR);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33325;The 3ème DCR was formed on March 20th, 1940 in Chatou, near Paris. This armored division was placed under the command of general Georges Louis Marie Brocard and assigned to the 1er Groupement Cuirassé. It was then assembled at Mourmelon and sent into combat on May 14th.\nThe 3ème DCR participated in the battle of Stonne (May 15th-27th) under the command of Jean Flavignyâ€™s 21ème Corps d'Armée. Flavigny was tasked to take back the village of Stonne, a strategic position in the heights south of the German bridgehead of Sedan over the river Meuse. Alongside the 3ème Division dâ€™Infanterie Motorisée, French tankers equipped with the powerful B1-Bis heavy tank attacked the VI. Armee-Korps and XIV. Armee-Korps (mot.), composed of the 10. Panzerdivision, IR Grossdeutschland, 16. and 24. Infanterie-Divisionen. Germany lost 26,000 soldiers for 7,500 French casualties which made it the most costly battle in the West for the Reich. Both generals Herman Hoth and Heinz Guderian emphasized how important this battle was and even though the village was lost and recaptured 17 times, it was firmly held by German troops on May 17th, preventing Flavigny from leading a strong attack on the Sedan bridgehead.\nAfter the battle of Stonne, the 3ème DCR was forced to abandon almost all of its heavy tanks and then retreated south until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33326;Formation of the 4ème Division Cuirassée de Réserve (4ème DCR);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33326;The 4ème DCR was formed on May 10th, 1940, when Germany launched its offensive toward the West. This ad hoc unit was formed from all available tank batallions from May 10th to May 27th. It reached a total of 364 armored vehicles : 58 B1-Bis heavy tanks, 44 D2 and 39 Somua S-35 medium tanks, 135 R-35, 40 H39 light tanks, and 48 Panhard AMD 178 armored cars.\nUnder the leadership of Colonel Charles de Gaulle, the division entered action on May 17th at Montcornet and Laon, pushing back German troops. From May 28th to May 30th, the 4ème DCR fought to take back the Abbeville salient and relieve the Allied forces trapped in Dunkerque. Despite heavy losses, the Bavarian 57. ID managed to repulse the advancing French tanks using its 37 mm Pak 36 and 88 mm Flak guns.\nAfter its failure, de Gaulle joined the French government and the 4ème DCR was attached to the 2ème Groupement Cuirassé (10ème Armée). In June, the armored division fought to protect the retreating troops on the river Loire until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33327;Corps Expéditionnaire FranÃ§ais en Scandinavie (CEFS);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33327;Created on February 28th, 1940 in order to help Finland, CEFS eventually was assigned a new task after the treaty of Moscow (March, 12th) bringing peace between the Soviet Union and Finland. Along with a British force, it was finally sent to Norway when Germany launched Operation WeserÃ¼bung.\nThis expeditionary corps was made up of three French light divisions of mountain troops, a brigade from the Légion étrangère, and also a Polish brigade, all assisted by a small amount of support troops:\nThe 1ère Division Légère de Chasseurs (1ère DLCh)\n2ème Division Légère de Chasseurs (2ème DLCh)\n3ère Division Légère d'Infanterie (DLI)\n13ème Demi-Brigade de Marche de la Légion étrangère (13ème DBMLE)\nBataillon autonome de Chasseurs de Podhale\nCEFS launched attacks on Namsos and Narvik alongside British and Norwegian troops from April 17th to June 8th. They were the last troops to leave Norway for France. The 2ème DLCh and 3ère DLI stayed in France because of the rapid advance of German forces after May 10th.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33328;Lâ€™Infanterie de lâ€™Air : French paratroopers creation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33328;Soviet development of paratrooper units impressed many countries such as France: the large scale 1935 exercise that took place in Kiev led the French general staff to authorize Captain Geille to open a paratrooper formation center in France. Trained as a paratrooper in the Soviet Union and already an established pilot, Geille started in September 1935 the formation of French paratroopers at the Centre d'Instruction Parachustiste in Avignon. Two company-sized units, the 601ème and 602ème Groupe d'Infanterie de l'Air (GIA) were established respectively in Reims and Baraki (Algeria).\nThese units were specially trained for dropping small combat groups behind the enemy lines, using Potez 650 and Farman 224 transport planes. In September 1939, they were ready to jump on Walcheren (Nederlands) but were not engaged. Finally, they were used as "Corps Francs" under the command of the 28e Division d'infanterie alpine stationed in Alsace. They led patrols and ambushes behind ennemy lines during the Phoney war. They were transferred to North Africa and finally disbanded in August 1940.\nIn 1942, the experience of the GIA led to the creation of the 1er Régiment de chasseurs parachutistes (1er RCP) who chose the insignia of the former 601ème GIA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33329;Formation of 10ème Armée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33329;The French 10ème Armée was created on May 31th and tasked to hold a defensive line along the river Seine after the German breaktrough of the Somme defenses. This army is placed under the command of general Robert Marie Altmayer, a former cavalry officer retired in 1937 and recalled at the outbreak of hostilities to command the 10ème Région militaire (Military sector around Paris).\nAltmayer could only rely on a few troops under three corps (3ème Corps d'Armée, Corps de Cavalerie motorisé, 25ème Corps d'Armée), totaling 3 DLI, 1 DLC, 3 DLM, some tanks, cavalry and reconnaissance groups.\nThe 25ème Corps dâ€™Armée was set up the day after and put under the command of general Sylvestre Audet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33330;Formation of Corps de Cavalerie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33330;The French Corps de Cavalerie (Cavalry Corps) was organized between September and December 1939 in order to command light mechanized divisions (DLM). Despite its name, it was a fully motorised army corps assigned to the 1ème Armée. Its commander was general René Prioux, former general-inspector of cavalry forces. This corps was initially in charge of the 1ère DLM and 2ème DLM. When the 1ère DLM joined the 7ème Armée in February 1940, it was replaced by the newly formed 3ème DLM.\nAccording to the Dyle-Breda plan established by Allied forces, Corps de Cavalerie was supposed to rapidly advance into Belgium, stop or delay advancing German forces and allow time for French divisions to set up a defensive line in Belgium. In May, Priouxâ€™s forces were engaged in the Battle of Hannut against Hoepnerâ€™s XVI. Armeekorps and were able to inflict heavy losses (164 tanks destroyed, 30 damaged) before withdrawing. In June, after being encircled in Dunkerqueâ€™s pocket, the motorised corps were reformed and assigned to Altmayerâ€™s 10ème Armée, under command of general Langlois. The 3 remaining DLM, lacking tanks, could only lead delaying actions until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33331;Formation of the 23ème Corps d'Armée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33331;The 23ème Corps dâ€™Armée was set up on November 27th 1939 under the command of général Maxime Germain and assigned as a reserve force to the GQG.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33332;Formation of the 24ème Corps d'Armée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33332;The 24ème Corps dâ€™Armée was set up on February 1940 under the command of général FranÃ§ois Fougère and assigned to the 3ème Armée. It was in charge of the 51ème Division dâ€™Infanterie â€“ a Type B reserve infantry division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33333;Formation of 1er Groupement Cuirassé;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33333;The French 1er Groupement Cuirassé (1st Armored Corps) was created in January 1940 to coordinate actions of the 1ère and 2ème Divisions Cuirassées. It was attached to the Reserve GQG and put under command of general Louis Keller. Almost destroyed at the battle of Flavion, the armored corps were recreated in June and assigned to general Charles Delestraint. It led delaying actions covering the retreat of French infantry until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33334;Formation of 2ème Groupement Cuirassé;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33334;The French 2ème Groupement Cuirassé (2nd Armored Corps) was created in June 1940 and put under command of general Louis Buisson, former commander of the 3ème Division Cuirassé.\nThis armored corps was coordinating various unitsÂ :\n3ème Division Cuirassée\n7ème DLM\n10th Polish Armored Brigade (Maczek Brigade)\n508ème Groupement de bataillons de chars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33335;Formation of Czechoslovakian troops in France;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33335;After the dissolution of their state, Czechs and Slovakians in exile started to join the French Légion Etrangère expecting the fight to come against Germany. On October 2nd, 1939, the Czech governement in exile agreed to the creation of an army under French military command. Formation of units started in the Agde camp (near Béziers) on September 26th, amalgamating soldiers from various origins: International brigade volunteers, soldiers in exile, people from Czech and Slovakian origins living in France. It resulted in tensions between soldiers and officers, Czech and Slovak soldiers, and recent and former migrants. \nOn January 15th, 1940 the 1st Czechoslovakian Division with 11,000 men was formed. In June, general Vuillemin decided to recreate the Czechoslovakian Airforce in France with 800 aviators â€“ with some 112 fighter pilots â€“ who escaped Czechoslovakia in March 1938. Between July and October 1940 a Light Bomber and two Fighter Groups were organized. Only two regiments were sent to the front in June 1940. The 1st Regiment was engaged as part of the 23ème DI and the 2nd one fought with the 239ème Division Légère d'Infanterie, a unit created from the remnants of destroyed divisions in May. Some 4500 soldiers (800 aviators) escaped in late June 1940 to keep fighting alongside England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33336;Divisions Légères d'Infanterie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33336;The 'Divisions Légères dâ€™Infanterie' (DLI - Light Infantry Divisions) were desperately formed in late May and early June 1940, assembling units in formation and remnants of destroyed divisions, especially from the Dunkerque pocket. The best description of these units was made by general Robert Altmayer (10th Army commander) in his memoirÂ :\n"Light Infantry Divisions (DLI), from recent formation, only had 2 infantry regiments (instead of 3) and 2 or 3 groups of artillery (instead of 5). They werenâ€™t â€˜lightâ€™ by nature of its constituting elementsÂ ; they were â€˜smallâ€™Â ; they were only â€˜mixed brigadesâ€™.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33337;Divisions Légère d'Infanterie coloniale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33337;The DLIC (Divisions Légères d'Infanterie coloniale - Colonial Light Infantry Divisions) were set up alongside DLI in a desperate attempt to stop the German blitzkrieg in early June 1940.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33340;Artillerie lourde sur voie ferrée (ALVF);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33340;The French army extensively used heavy railway artillery during WW1, building a massive force of 6 regiments (more than 500 guns) from scratch. After the war, the guns were grouped in a single regiment: the 152ème RAP. During the thirties, plans were made to use these guns behind the Maginot line. At the outbreak of hostilities, France mobilized 4 heavy railway artillery regiments ('Régiments d'Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferrée' - RALVF) totaling 116 guns of various calibers. Main calibers were 400 mm Mle 1916. Most of these guns were captured by Germany and sent to the Eastern Front in 1941 or used to equip the Atlantic wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33341;Nationalization of French aircraft industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33341;Pierre Cot, secretary of the French Air Force, decreed that national security was too important for the production of warplanes to be left in the hands of private enterprises. Therefore in July 1936 the French government began nationalizing many of the larger aircraft companies, creating six state-owned companies, which encompassed the majority of aeronautical production. However, the aircraft engine industry, even as it proved incapable of providing the badly needed powerful engines, escaped nationalization. Despite these efforts, French industry couldn't produce enough aircraft and Pierre Cot turned to the USA to solve this issue by buying American planes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33342;Buy American planes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33342;Talks started in the political circlesÂ : ambassador in France William Bullitt was introduced to Jean Monnet in the USA during February 1936. Monnet's purpose was to pass an order of 300 Curtiss P-36 "Hawk" fighters.\nNegotiations focused on the low rate of production and exportation of aircraft and met the opposition of the USAAC to sell abroad a fighter much needed at home. Curtiss also didn't want a French test pilot to discover the secrets of the P-36. Monnet and Bullitt met F.D. Roosevelt on March 5th who intervened to facilitate negotiations. An order of 100 aircraft was passed in May, under the Curtiss H.75 type A designation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33343;The Monnet-Hoppenot Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33343;As a consequence of the German annexation of the Sudetenland, France increased its rearmament efforts. French Président du Conseil Edouard Daladier asked Jean Monnet to order one thousand aircarft. Monnet led this mission and bought 695 aircraft for a total of 84.1 million dollars. There was a scandal when the American press discovered the action of French negotiators to buy US equipment. Roosevelt explained his position arguing that this help to the French will also help the development of US industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33344;USA gets a new order from France;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33344;Shall we build these aircraft for France? We'll get some new aircraft factories, and get paid with money and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33345;First shipment has arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33346;The Jacquin-Thouvenot Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33346;Negotiations went on in 1939 to get more aircraft from the US industry. In February 1939, both France and the United Kingdom sent missions to buy new aircraft. The French ordered 200 medium bomber aircraft Martin 167 designated "F" for France (as the British ones were designated "B" or "Maryland"). Jean Monnet went back to meet President Roosevelt in April 1939 to ensure that neutrality acts could be bypassed and French production orders honored. At the end of August 1939, the Jacquin-Thouvenot mission was ordered by Paul Reynaud to buy all the American aircraft available. It ordered 1280 aircraft at high costs (aircraft had to be bought and at the same time French money financed the production lines). It was mainly fighters like the Curtiss H.75 and the brand new Curtiss P-40. War created a new environment for these negotiations. An Anglo-French coordinating committee ("Conseil anglo-franÃ§ais des fournitures de guerre") was also created in November 1939 by Jean Monnet with the authorisation of Edouard Daladier and Neville Chamberlain, using the possibilities offered by the Cash and Carry act (November, 4th 1939).\n\nAlthough France passed orders for 2035 aircrafts and 8805 engines â€“ at a cost of 337 millions dollars â€“ only 655 aircraft of various models (Glenn-Martin 167-F, North American BT9B, Douglas DB-7, Curtiss Hawk 75 and Chance Vought 156) were delivered. 469 were involved in combat. Because of French capitulation, other orders were shipped to England and reinforced the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33350;French Curtiss H.75 in combat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33350;French Curtiss H.75 equipped five fighter units (Groupes de Chasse III/2, I/4, II/4, I/5 and II/5) and attained 234 victories for the loss of 200 aircraft in combat, accidents or capture by the enemy between September 1939 and June 1940. \nGroupe de Chasse II/4 named "Les Petits Poucets" shot down the two first Me-109 on the Western front on September 8th, 1939. With that plane, French ace Lieutnant Edmond Marin la Meslée (Groupe de Chasse I/5) shot down 16 enemy aircrafts making him the best French ace of the "Campagne de France".\nFrench Curtiss planes were still in service in the Vichy Air Force during Operation Torch (November 1942) where they faced Grumman F4F Wildcats from the US Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33351;Creation of the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33351;L'Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) was created on April 1st, 1933 and became an independant armed branch on July 2nd, 1934. General Joseph Vuillemin was appointed as head of the Air Force from February 1938 to the outbreak of war.\nThis force was structured in two different commands:\n - Forces aériennes réservées (Reserved Air Forces) were under direct command of General Vuillemin and were to be engaged in ground combat.\n - Forces aériennes de coopération (Cooperation Air Forces) were under the command of the Armée de Terre, assigned to each Army. They were composed of fighters, recon, and artillery spotting aircraft. In 1939, half of the fighter and recon groups of the Armée de l'Air belonged to these Forces aériennes de coopération.\n\nThe basic tactical unit is a "Groupe" (Group â€“ Squadron sized unit), composed of two or three "Escadrilles" (Flights), totaling 24 fighters or 16-20 bombers and less recon aircraft. 2 or 3 "Groupes" are assembled into an "Escadre" (Wing sized unit).\n Attachment to an "Escadre" is still noticeable in the Squadron denomination: for example, GCII/1 means "Groupe de Chasse NÂ°2" (Fighter Group NÂ°2) attached to Première Escadre (1st Wing).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33352;Armée de l'Air - command reorganization (1);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33352;In an attempt to reorganize its air forces to be more efficient, French High Command decided to disband in September 1939 the former district organization. It was replaced by 4 "Zones d'Opérations Aériennes" (Air Operations Areas): ZOAN (North), ZOAE (East), ZOAS (South), ZOAA (Alps).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33353;Armée de l'Air - command reorganisation (2);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33353;Tensions between the Army and Air Force provoked a new reorganization of Air Forces Commmand. A new HQ - Forces Aériennes de Coopération du Nord-Est (FACNE), under command of general Marcel TÃªtu, was tasked to support ground forces. An important part of the air forces were sent back under direct army command, annihilating Vuillemin's efforts to create a independent force.\nLack of coordination persisted in May and June 1940, preventing Armée de l'Air from having a significant impact in the battle of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33354;Launch the Richelieu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33354;The idea of the Battleship class 'Richelieu' was formulated in the mid-thirties to counter the development of the Italian navy who ordered the construction of battleships Littorio and Vittorio Veneto. It was designed to have its main armament (380 mm guns) in 2 front quadruple turrets, like the previous Dunkerque class battlecruiser. Richelieu was laid down in Brest on October 1935 but construction was interrupted by multiple delays provocated by inadequate AA and secondary artillery. On June 18th, 1940, the ship escaped Brest to Dakar at 90% completion. Under Vichy command, Richelieu participated in Dakar's defense against British and Free French forces (September 1940). After the Allied landings in North Africa, Richelieu joined the Free French and was sent in early 1943 in the New York Naval Yard to be refitted. Then she took part in the battles of the Indian Ocean alongside British Forces and participated in the First Indochina War before being scrapped in 1968.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33355;Launch the Jean Bart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33355;Jean Bart was the second Richelieu class battleship and the last battleship built by France. She was laid down in December 1936 in Saint-Nazaire and was supposed to be launched in October 1940. Because of the German advance, construction work was accelerated and the ship was able to escape France in June 1940 to be rebased in Casablanca. Vichy France lacked resources to finish the Jean Bart, which was damaged by the Allies during Operation Torch. The ship remained inactive until 1955 when it reentered service, before being scrapped in 1970.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33356;Légion Etrangère;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33356;The French Foreign Legion ('la Légion Etrangère' or simply 'la Légion') was set up in the 19th Century to incorporate all non-French soldiers serving France in a unique corps. Its units are made of infantry (REI 'Régiment étranger d'infanterie'), cavalry (REC 'Régiment étranger de cavalerie'), and engineers, and can be identified by special dressing and high level training giving the Légion a strong 'esprit de corps'. By contract, Legionaries were not supposed to serve on European mainland - to avoid being engaged against fellow countrymen - and were sent abroad, especially in the colonies like Northern Africa. The Great War introduced an important change as troops were deployed in France but they soon came back to their former affectations.\n\nÂ§RNote for player: French Foreign Legion regiments are already deployed in French colonies or SDN mandates: 2e, 3e and 4e REI are deployed in Morocco alongside 2e REC, 1e REI stands in Algeria, 1e REC in Tunisia. 6e REI is deployed in Beirut and 5e REI in Hanoi, Vietnam. More units were created later, to integrate volunteers from Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, etc.Â§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33357;Classes creuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33357;A low birth rate phenomenon, called in French 'classes creuses' had dramatic effects on French manpower at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939. During the Great War, France lost 1,335,000 men and between 1914 and 1919, France's birth rate dropped harder than every European country, as French population had already a very low fecondity level. Lack of manpower forced French general staff to rely more and more on its colonial forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33358;Mobilize more manpower from our colonial empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33358;Triggering this decision will give you more manpower at the cost of some dissent and national unity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33360;Maginot Line;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33360;The Maginot Line ('la Ligne Maginot'), named after the French Minister of War André Maginot, was a line of concrete fortifications, obstacles, and weapon installations built by France from 1929 to 1938 to deter invasion by Germany or at least slow an attack, allowing full mobilization and counter-attack. The Maginot Line had a total of 142 ouvrages, 352 casemates, 78 shelters, 17 observatories and around 5,000 blockhouses from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Fortifications were manned by fortress troops ('Régiments de Forteresse') consisting of infantry, artillery and engineer units.\n\nÂ§RNote for player: Maginot Line forces are divided in Fortress Divisions and many sectors called 'Secteur défensif - SD' or 'Secteur fortifié - SF' that are already in your starting OBB.Â§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33361;Dyle-Breda Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33361;Dyle-Breda Plan was the plan made by French CiC Maurice Gamelin in order to defeat a German attempt to invade France through Belgium. The French 1st Army group made of the best and mobile elements of French Army like DCR, DLM, DLC and motorised infantry divisions were supposed to enter Belgium and stop the German advance on the river Dyle ('Plan Dyle' or 'Plan D'). During the winter of 1939-1940, Gamelin altered Plan D with the Breda variant: an advance to Breda (North Brabant, in Holland) to link with the Dutch Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33362;Vers L'Armée de métier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33362;In this book published in 1934, Colonel Charles de Gaulle laid out a vast plan of reform and modernisation of the French Army. Considering that the Maginot Line was not suited for modern warfare, de Gaulle recommended the formation of 6 tank divisions (Division cuirassée de réserve or DCR) made of 500 tanks each and manned by volunteers and not conscripts, to repeal a potential German attack. Although de Gaulle's ideas found supporters in some countries like Germany, Soviet Union, Great Britain and the USA, French high command rejected his proposal and continued assigning an infantry support mission to French armor.\nFinally, impressed by the successes of Herman panzerdivisions, France started to constitute DCR like Charles de Gaulle asked for six years before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME32500;The Independence Of Lebanon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32500;Lebanon had been under French rule since 1920, which established the borders of Greater Lebanon. During WWII, Vichy commissioner Henri Dentz allowed German military supplies and aircraft through Lebanon and Syria to Iraq. This encouraged Britain to fully invade, which it did, occupying the entire country by 1941. General Charles de Gaulle recognised Lebanon's independence after visiting and General Georges Catroux announced it would become independent on November 26th, 1941. Elections were held in 1943 and on November 8th the new government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French responded by imprisoning the government, resulting in immediate pressure by Britain (and Egypt) which led to the French reluctantly releasing the officials and accepting its independence. However, should France so choose, they can opt instead to keep hold of Lebanon, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
