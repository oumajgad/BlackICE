EVTDESC33509;The 2nd Shanghai incident, as known as "Battle of Shanghai" was the first major engagement fought between Republic of China and Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war. On August 9, an incident at the Hongqiao Airport heightened the tensions between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the Shanghai International Settlement. Japan began sending in reinforcements to Shanghai asking for a total withdraw of chinese forces in the area.\n A fierce three-month battle occurred, involving more than 70 divisions (700,000 men) on the chinese side facing 9 japanese divisions supporte by planes, tanks, heavy artillery and ships from the 3rd Fleet, totalizing 300,000 men.
