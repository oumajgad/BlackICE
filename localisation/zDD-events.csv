EVTDESC99999;This mod is meant to be played historically - at least until Pearl Harbour.\n\nIn keeping with the historical timeline and to have some actual action, there are scripted historical invasions for the major countries, such as Operation Overlord or the invasions of Italy, Africa or the Pacific Theatre.\n\nYou can disable these scripts if you wish, but be aware that the AI is dumb and you may find the game frustrating if Japan doesn't attack the Pacific Islands, or if Italy doesn't defend Libya.\n\nSometimes you will see that a country annexes itself - this is not a bug.

EVTDESC91003;Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was the code name for Germany's massive invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June, 1941.\n\nOver 4.5 million troops of the Axis powers invaded the USSR along a 2,900 km (1,800 mile) front, from the Baltic to the Black Sea.\n\nIt was the largest military offensive in history. In addition to the large number of troops, it also involved 600,000 motor vehicles and 750,000 horses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,

EVTDESC91008;According to his orders, on 5 December 1940 Hitler received military plans for the invasion of Soviet Union, and approved them all, with the start scheduled for May 1941. On 18 December 1940, Hitler signed War Directive No. 21 to the German High Command for an operation now codenamed 'Operation Barbarossa' stating: 'The German Wehrmacht must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign'.\n\nChoosing to prepare the Wehrmacht will grant the Soviet Union a -75% organisation surprise-penalty at the start of Operation Barbarossa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME88021;Sino-German cooperation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88021;China's urgency to modernize its military and national defence industry, coupled with Germany's need for a stable supply of raw materials, put the two countries on the road of close relations from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.\n\nAlthough intense cooperation lasted only from the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933 to the start of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937, and concrete measures at industrial reform started in earnest only in 1936, it had a profound effect on Chinese modernization and the capability of the Chinese to resist the Japanese in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

By 1530 hrs, 11th Hussars had cleared the fort at Msus of the Italian rearguard, but it was realised that the tanks were moving too slowly. It was decided that the faster vehicles and the infantry of the Rifle Brigade, in Bren Gun Carriers, would join the 11th Hussars, who were now far ahead of the main force.\n\nThe force was placed under the command of Lt-Colonel John Combe (11th Hussars) and was therefore called Combeforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,
EVTDESC48936;During the Third Battle of Kharkov, Meyer's battalion frequently co-operated with Wünsche's SS-Panzer-Regiment 1, Theodor Teddy Wischs SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 2 and Joachim Peiper's III. Battalion, SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 2.  These ad hoc Kampfgruppen acted like fire brigades, rushing from one crisis point to another, rescuing trapped German troops and capturing Soviet officers.  Meyers battalion captured the entire command staff of a Soviet division near Jeremejewka and Aleksandrowka.\n\nIn the final phase of the capture of Kharkov, the Leibstandarte's role was to capture the huge central plaza, called Red Square. Meyer, Wünsche and Peiper all led Kampfgruppen which were to take responsibility of capturing the city.  Meyer led his battalion in a high speed charge to the square, capturing part of it before being cut off by Soviet defenders.\n\nMeyer and his grenadiers held their ground against vastly larger Soviet forces until they were relieved by Peipers Kampfgruppe on 13 March.  Together with Peipers Kampfgruppe and the rest of Teddy Wischs regiment, Meyers battalion finally cleared the city centre after a desperate and bloody fight.  In honour of this action, Red Square was renamed Platz der Leibstandarte.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,
EVTDESC48937;In early March, Witt's regiment now took part in the Third Battle of Kharkov.  Witt's force was reinforced with tanks, artillery and assault guns, and was given the task of attacking from the North.  The force, renamed Kampfgruppe Witt, was to form one of three pincers which would destroy Mobile Group Popov and recapture Kharkov.\n\nThe attack got underway on 2 March, and by 10 March KG Witt had reached the suburbs of Kharkov.  After ferocious fighting near Dergatschi, Witt broke through and advanced into the city centre, fighting alongside Kurt Meyer's Kampfgruppe Meyer.\n\nOver the next few days, the Kampfgruppen of Witt and Meyers' saw intense fighting, and were cut off several times inside the city.  Despite this, they held and Kampfgruppe Peiper under Joachim Peiper reached them and together the three Leibstandarte units annihilated the Soviet defenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,
EVTDESC48938;$MONARCHTITLE$, it is time to hit the enemy hard!  The 2nd Cavalry Group has assembled in Norwich, England, and are ready to meet the Jerrys head-on!\n\nHistorically: During World War II," this regiment (under the designation "2nd Cavalry Group"," Mechanized") landed in France in July 1944", becoming part of General Patton's Third Army. During this period," the regiment became known as the "Ghosts of Patton's Army" due to their ability to conduct reconnaissance", materializing seemingly at will behind German lines. The regiment made the deepest penetration of the war, arriving in Czechoslovakia before finally linking up with Soviet forces heading west. Under the leadership of Colonel Charles H. Reed, the regiment rescued the famous Lipizzaner stallions from the combat zone and brought them to safety in Germany. At the end of the war, the unit was re-designated, yet again, as the 2nd Constabulary Regiment, and eventually the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1948.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The 158th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) is ready to deploy to Papua New Guinea.\n\n"One of America's most colorful and least known soldiers of World War II is the Bushmaster...His tactics are borrowed from native jungle fighters", the American Indian, British commandos, exponents of judo and the Shanghai underworld...(He uses) machetes, curved knives, tommy guns, high-powered rifles, and hand grenades...His average age is 22 and his favorite weapon is the long-bladed machete...With his fellow Bushmasters, he disappears from civilization for weeks at a time. The men know how to sustain themselves on wild fare supplemented by (jungle rations) carried in their packs. When they are not testing their camouflage against aerial observers, making camp in a swamp, or working out an intricate code of communications," they are practicing jujitsu or improve on the native's technique with the machete. The Bushmaster bows to no man in the art of hand-to-hand fighting and any unwary (enemy) who crosses his path would probably never know what hit him."\n\n- Popular Mechanics Magazine", 1943;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,
EVTDESC48940;$MONARCHTITLE$, it is time to hit the enemy hard!  The 370th Regimental Combat Team has assembled at Ft. Huachuca, Arizona, and are ready to meet the Jerrys head-on!\n\nHistorically: The 370th Infantry Regiment arrived in Naples, Italy on 1 August 1944, attached to the Task Force 42 at US 1st Armored Division. The 370th entered combat on 24 August 1944. It participated in the crossing of the Arno River, the occupation of Lucca and the penetration of the Gothic Line, in the persecution of an enemy which was retreating of that area. It was later was attached to the US 92nd Division at the Task Force 45, the US 5th Army unit responsible for the Ligurian coastal sector, the left flank of Allied troops in Italy.\n\nOn 1 April, the 370th RCT and the attached 442nd RCT (Nisei) attacked in the Ligurian coastal sector and drove rapidly north against light opposition of German 148th Infantry Division supported by Italian coastal units. The 370th took over the Serchio sector and pursued a retreating enemy from 18 April until the collapse of enemy forces, 29 April 1945. Elements of the 92nd Division entered La Spezia and Genoa on the 27th and took over selected towns along the Ligurian coast until the enemy surrendered, 2 May 1945. Between August 1944 and May 1945 the 92nd Division suffered 3,200 casualties, factoring losses from units attached to the Division brings the totals up to 5,000 casualties;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

The Battalion was the third of four Parachute Battalions formed prior to the beginning of World War II.\n\nLater the unit was expanded into a Combat Team with the assignment of the 462d Parachute Artillery Battalion on 29 March 1944 and the 161st Parachute Engineer Company on 13 September 1944.\n\nDuring its more than three years service in the Southwest Pacific Theater, the 503rd served in five major combat operations. A number of other missions were planned but called off by higher headquarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC48942;$MONARCHTITLE$, it is time to hit the enemy hard!  The 1st Marine Parachute Regimental Combat Team has assembled near San Diego, California, and are ready to meet our enemies head-on!\n\nHistorically: The Paramarines (also known as Marine paratroopers) was a short-lived specialized combat unit of the United States Marine Corps, trained to be dropped from planes by parachute. Marine parachute training which began in New Jersey in October 1940 ended with the parachute units being disbanded at Camp Pendleton, California in February 1944. Paratroopers received a significantly increased salary after completing training, so there was no shortage of volunteers, although all were required to be unmarried. Standards of fitness were high, and 40% failed the training course.\n\nApart from a small group including Peter Julien Ortiz who were parachuted into France as part of an Office of Strategic Services team to support the French Resistance, the Paramarines never dropped by parachute into combat, but were utilized during beach raids in the Pacific campaign, including at Guadalcanal. Paramarines at San Diego were transferred to the 5th Marine Division which landed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC48898;$MONARCHTITLE$, the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team (PRCT) is ready to deploy for training at Camp Toccoa, in the North Georgia mountains. Historically:\n\nThe 517th PRCT was one of the U.S. Army's first elite combat units.  The 517th PRCT was formed when the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment was combined with the 460th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion and the 596th Parachute Combat Engineer Company.\n\nThe 517th saw most of its combat in Italy, Southern France, and the Battle of the Bulge as an independent unit.  During its relatively brief lifetime, the 517th Regimental Parachute Combat Team collected one Medal of Honor, six Distinguished Service Crosses, five Legions of Merit, 131 Silver Stars, 631 Bronze Stars, two Air Medals, four Soldiers Medals, 17 French Croix De Guerre, and 1,576 Purple Hearts, at the cost of 252 killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

EVTDESC92100;Schwerer (Heavy) Gustav and Dora were the names given to two massive German 80 cm K (E) railway siege guns.\n\nThey were developed in the 1930s by Krupp Armaments in order to destroy heavily fortified positions, such as the Maginot forts.\n\nWeighing nearly 1,350 tonnes each, they could fire seven tonne shells to a range of 37 kilometres (23 miles).  They were the largest calibre rifled weapon in the history of artillery to see actual combat, and fired the heaviest shells of any artillery piece.\n\nIf you decide to build these units, you will be able to deploy them in a few months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

Some units were sent to infiltrate India, Afghanistan, Middle East countries and South Africa.  They also trained for Operation Felix (the planned seizure of Gibraltar), and Operation Sealion.  They had stunning successes early in the war acting as advance units capturing strategic bridges, tunnels, forts, and rail yards in Poland and the Netherlands.\n\nYou will receive three units of Brandenburgers: the first in 1938, the second in early 1940 and the last one in the middle of 1940.

This precise long-range weapon was supposed to take out enemy tanks before they reached their own optimal firing range.  Ninety-one chassis were converted.

EVTNAME91300;You can build a Kamikaze air group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91300;The Japanese word kamikaze is usually translated as 'divine wind'.  The word kamikaze originated as the name of major typhoons in 1274 and 1281, which dispersed Mongolian invasion fleets.  In Japanese, the formal term used for units carrying out suicide attacks during 1944-45 is tokubetsu kogeki tai, which literally means 'special attack unit'.  This is usually abbreviated to tokkotai. \n\nYou can build the kamikaze units in the air brigade screen.  Deploy them to an airport, and then aboard any carrier that has room for them.  Being a suicide unit doesn't mean that you'll have to build a lot of them - the unit will attack, lose strength and withdraw to the carrier in order to regain strength (with manpower reinforcements).  A single unit is able to perform many strikes if you let it rest occasionally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

At that time, Japan experienced a decreasing capacity to wage war, the loss of experienced pilots, and a rapidly declining industrial capacity relative to the United States.  The Japanese government expressed its reluctance to surrender.  In combination," these factors led to the use of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese home islands.\n\nYou are able to pick a Kamikaze Tactics Decision in the diplomatic screen.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

The FinnishRussian border was determined by the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, largely following the historic border but granting Petsamo and its Barents Sea harbour to Finland.\n\nFinnish democracy did not see any more Soviet coup attempts and survived the anti-Communist Lapua Movement. The relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union was tense. Germany's relations with Finland were also not good. The military was trained in France instead, and relations to Western Europe and Sweden were strengthened.\n\nIn 1917 the population of the country was 3 million. About 70% of workers were occupied in agriculture and 10% in industry. The largest export markets were the United Kingdom and Germany.

In 1940, it was decided to send a new fighter, the Caudron-Renault C.714. Six C.714s previously marked for shipment to the Polish Air Force were placed in containers and diverted to Le Havre harbour for shipment to Finland.

EVTNAME99502;Balkan Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99502;The Balkan Pact was a mutual-defense agreement between Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia, intended to guarantee the signatories territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state (i.e., Bulgaria or Albania). The agreement provided for a Permanent Council, composed of the members foreign ministers, that would coordinate legislation and foster economic cooperation.\n\nDespite professions of unity, the Balkan Entente was ineffective against growing German economic and political influence in the Balkans (193439) and against actual Axis aggression during World War II, when Albania had already fallen to the Italians. The entente likewise offered no security to Romania against the territorial claims of either the Soviet Union or Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,

EVTNAME99503;Titulescu Removed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99503;"In June 1936"," Foreign Affairs Minister Nicolae Titulescu famously reacted to the buffoonery exhibited by the Italian journalists when Emperor Haile Selassie I spoke to the League after Ethiopia had been invaded and occupied by Fascist Italy. He jumped to his feet and shouted: To the door with the savages! ("A la porte les sauvages!").\n\nLater in 1936", under pro-Nazi parties pressure, King Carol II removed Titulescu from all official positions, asking him to leave the country. Settling first in Switzerland, he later moved to France. While in exile, Nicolae Titulescu continued through conferences and newspaper articles to propagate the idea of the preservation of peace, perceiving the danger of a war that was to come all too soon after. He returned to Romania in November 1937," partly through the efforts of Iuliu Maniu.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTOPTA99503;That's terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME99504;Economic Agreement with Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99504;After Titulescu's removal, an improvement in the relationship with Germany was necessary due to it's significant rise of power while French influence was constantly fading. The pro-German policy of Romanias allies, Poland and Yugoslavia, was another reason for this new orientation. Romanias economic relation with Germany was very much in Romanias favour. It provided a market for its agricultural products, a source of advanced technology that allowed a modernization of industry, and an alternative armament supplier. The economic agreement of December 1937 that led to an enhancement of economic trade showed the important place that Germany had gained in the Romanian economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,
EVTNAME99505;Polish-Romanian Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99505;"Having accomplished the wishes of unity and independence by the end of World War I", Romania and Poland were interested in building relationships of friendship and cooperation between them in order to defend national sovereignty. Polish-Romanian political relations were initiated on 3 March 1921 by a treaty of friendship and cooperation that both countries pledged To provide mutual help in case one of them would be attacked, without provocation, on their part on their common borders in the east.\n\nOnce one of the Contracting States would be attacked, in terms of constituting a casus foederis,in accordance with provisions established between the two states," the co-signing State shall have the obligation to enact immediate mobilization as well. Between 1921 and 1931 there were numerous meetings to establish the concrete modalities of action of the Polish-Romanian forces to repel an attack from the east.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTNAME99506;Erga Omnes alliance rejected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99506;In 1936, Czech diplomacy initiated talks with its counterparts to transform the Little Entente in an erga omnes (towards all) alliance. This would have meant that Romania would have been obliged to support Czechoslovakia in case of a German attack. A treaty with France would have consolidated the pact. Romania declined. This attitude generated a division in the Little Entente. Romanian refusal was also due to the fact that the treaty would have given the USSR the right to cross its territory in order to help Czechoslovakia. For the same reason, Romania refused the conclusion of the mutual assistance pact with France. The pact would have granted France or its ally the Soviet Union permission to use Romanian air bases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME99507;Electoral non-aggression pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Also adhering to it will be the national liberal group directed by George Bratianu and the Agrarian Union led by Constantin Argetoianu. While denouncing the electoral non-aggression pact", the Romanian Communist Party supports, on the local level, the National-Peasants. The election would point out the dangerous rise in popularity of the far-right movement and the political party called Everything for the Country - the official name of the Iron Guard after 1935.\n\nThe Guard - an ultra-nationalist, anti-communist, antisemitic and fascist in-character movement, would thus secure a front line presence in Romanian politics until January 24,1941," when it was dismantled after a failed coup against dictator Ion Antonescu.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTNAME99508;Octavian Goga forms a government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99508;After the elections, King Carol II used the pretext that no party was able to get a majority of 40%, and nominated Octavian Goga, the president of the National-Christian Party, as Prime Minister, asking him to form a government, although his party received less than 10% of the votes. This was only the first step in the royal dictatorship. In doing so, the king placed several hits to the PNT party and its leader, Iuliu Maniu: PNT was to be removed from its succession, although it did receive double the amount of PNC's votes, the head of the government was to be an old, determined political adversary of Maniu, and several key members of PNT were to be lured to the king's side, including the newly appointed Minister of Interior, Armand Calinescu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99509;Sir, as more and more unconfirmed reports are brought to our attention related to clandestine Hungarian rearmament, it is vital that we direct our attention to strengthening our western border. Our army, while sufficient in numbers and equipment, needs some time to redeploy accordingly, in order to face an agression coming from the west.\n\nMeasures must be taken so that incoming-attack avenues would be properly blocked and enemy progress on Romanian soil conveniently delayed long enough for us to mount credible defenses and swift counter-attacks. The High Command has issued the plans for a 300 km-length system of 320 concrete bunkers, integrated in a fortified line spreading from the north-western county of Maramures to the western county of Arad.\n\nBe advised though that such an expenditure would claim a large percentage of our defense budget for several years, so your decision should not be taken lightly...Sir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,

EVTNAME99512;Carol II's personal authority regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99512;The beginning of 1938 faced a rise of the Iron Guard, which was fiercely attacking the regime ruling the country in order to shift Romania's foreign policy towards the Berlin - Rome axis. Moreover, Prime-minister Goga wanted to win the elections in March 1938 and therefore negotiated a secret agreement with Corneliu Codreanu. Democratic forces were confused and confusing, which enabled Carol II to intervene decisively and achieve his political objective. By the coup of February 10,1938, Carol dismissed Goga of the Council of Ministers and triggered the creation of a government headed by Patriarch Miron Cristea. The 1923 Constitution was suspended and a new fundamental law was hastly developed and promulgated on February 27,1938, giving the king broad executive and legislative powers. By these acts, the monarchy ensured its dominance over the country's political scene, subordinating state institutions to Carol II's will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,
EVTNAME99513;Dissolution of political parties;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99513;The idea of the dissolutin of political parties was first brought up in the Council of Ministers' session on March 8, 1938. While there were voices claiming that parties would not just disappear, but rather hide in shadows.  On March 30, the decree-law for the dissolution of associations, groups and political parties has been published, a final hit to the democratic system.\n\nThe Act was also accompanied by a sustained campaign against traditional political parties: their headquarters and clubs were closed and sealed, their assets seized and transfered under the administration of the Ministry of Finance. King Carol II's choice was made considering that political parties severely diminished their impact on their voters, thus not proving a viable fundamental for the new political regime he had planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,
EVTNAME99514;Germany takes over Austrian businesses in Romania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99514;The Anschluss conferred on the Reich the economic domination and a strategic position in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Germany took over all the Austrian businesses in Romania. The 1934 German economic strategy, the Schacht Plan, introducing a new currency-control regime and German bilateral economic relations with the countries producing raw materials based on compensation arrangements, would soon be replaced by a New Plan, stipulating the concept of multilateral trade agreements and allowing the exchange of goods with countries with complementary economies.\n\nThe advantage for Romania would be that the New Plan was to provide a market for exported products at higher prices than those prevailing on world markets.  And Romanian food products were to be exchanged for German industrial goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME99515;Romanian Aeronautical Industry - I.A.R.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99515;To ensure that the Romanian air force could be continuously supplied with aircraft under all circumstances, including those of war, the Romanian government subsidized the creation of the necessary infrastructure for aircraft building in the years 1920-1930. The Romanian Aeronautical Industry was founded on 1 November 1925. Shares were initially split between Blériot-Spad and Lorraine-Dietrich companies, Astra Arad factory, which provided equipment and trained staff, and the Romanian state, which provided the land for factory building near an airfield and a significant amount of money. During a decade and a half, the Romanian state-owned factories bought the French shares so that on September 1, 1938 the company became fully owned by Romania. The most famous aircraft series produced by IAR were IAR 80 and IAR 81 fighter aircraft, which won a well-deserved prestige in their class.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,
EVTNAME99516;Little Entente breaks apart;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99516;In 1938 the Czechoslovakian crisis broke. As it was clear that Great Britain's and France's reaction was far too weak and no substantial military support would be given to Czechoslovakia, Romania was also reluctant to grant support to its ally, in order to avoid a potential war with Germany. As a member of the Little Entente, Romania and Yugoslavia were compelled to offer military support to Czechoslovakia in case of a Hungarian attack but not in case of a German one.\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 30th, 1938 made Romania once again conclude that it should not count on Western support and convinced it of the necessity of maintaining neutrality between the Great Powers. Also, the Munich Treaty enhanced the economic influence of Germany over the countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe. In Romania, Germany took over all the Czechoslovakian investments and became the main armament supplier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99517;Availing itself of the uncertain internal political climate as well as of the favourable international support of Germany and Italy, the Iron Guard increased it's pressure upon Romanian authorities through large scale public manifestations.\n\nFurthermore, on November 24th, 1938 during an official visit to Berlin, King Carol II was bluntly approached by Hitler relating to the immediate release from prison of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, and to the Romanian alignment to Axis international policies. The King perceived the Legionary Movement as a threat, then more than ever, and as a result, during the night of 29-30 November 1938, Codreanu and 13 others were killed while allegedly trying to escape from prison. A systematic campaign of the authorities for the dismantling of the Legion was initiated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Sensing the increased danger hanging over the country, the Romanian government asked the allied governments to state their willingness to provide military support, should it come to an aggression against its territory.

The prototype had mounted only two Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale 7.92 mm machine guns, a licensed modification of the Browning 30 cal. This armament suite was clearly not heavy enough for combat use, and the production model was supposed to mount six of these guns.\n\nThe German invasion of Belgium and the Low Countries in 1940 ended the supply of the FN guns, and there was no indigenous machine gun that was suitable for use in aircraft. It wasn't until November 1940 when Romania joined the Axis that the Germans eventually allowed the delivery of the guns to resume. As a result the first production IAR.80 didn't roll off the line until January 1941, although the first batch of 20 had been quickly delivered by the middle of February.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME91217;General Winter reporting for duty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91217;The Russian (or Soviet) Winter is a common explanation or justification for military failures of invaders in Russia. Common nicknames for the notion are General Winter and General Snow.\n\nThe average and minimal temperatures in Russian regions differ. In Yakutia the winter is most severe, with the lowest temperature around -55 to -65 °C (around -75 °F).  During WWII the only cold winter was in 1941-1942, and the Wehrmacht lacked necessary supplies, such as winter uniforms, due to the many delays in the German Army's movements.  Hitler's plans for Operation Barbarossa also miscarried before the onset of severe winter weather - he was so confident of a quick victory that he did not prepare for even the possibility of winter warfare in Russia.  This event will give you a bonus on the General Winter combat event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME91221;Begin the Great Officer Purge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91221;During the 1930's Stalin's paranoia had increased and numerous power struggles between lesser men were viewed as dangerous to his leadership.  In a wave of three major and a dozen smaller purges the political and military leadership of the Soviet Union was effectively decimated and put under the strict control of Stalin.\n\nThe purge of the army eliminated 3 of the 5 marshals, 14 of the 16 army commanders, and approximately half of the 70 to 80,000 men in the entire officer corps.  Needless to say, this purge inevitably had an extremely destructive effect on the effectiveness of the Red Army's military leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became sovereign nations in the aftermath of World War I.  They declared independence in 1918.

It first entered combat in the summer of 1944 as part of the 1st Belorussian Front on the right wing of the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, fighting in the battles during the Soviet crossing of the river Vistula around Deblin and Pulawy.  In September 1944 it was involved in fighting around Warsaw in an attempt to support the Warsaw Uprising.  However, those efforts received minimal Soviet support and ended in failure.

EVTNAME93600;Popular Front Publications;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93600;The idea of a 'Popular Front' came from two directions: First, the left-wing view, following the February 6, 1934 riots, that the far-right had tried to organize a coup d'état against the Republic.  Second, the Comintern's decision, before the increased popularity of fascist position, which advocated an alliance with the social democrats against the Right.\n\nThus, both the consequences of the 1934 riots, which had removed the second Cartel des gauches from power, and the new Comintern policies had seen anti-fascism as the main imperative of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Political circumstances changed in 1934, when the rise of German dictator Adolf Hitler and fascist riots in Paris caused Stalin and the French Communists to change their policy.

Although still a neutral nation, Reza Shah Pahlavi had brought Persia closer to Germany.  This concerned the British who feared that the Abadan Oil Refinery, owned by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, might fall into German hands  the refinery produced eight million tons of oil in 1940 and was thus a crucial part of the Allied war effort.  For the Soviets, Persia was a country of extreme strategic importance.  The German Army (Wehrmacht Heer) was steadily advancing through the Soviet Union and the Persian Corridor was one of the few ways for the Allies to get desperately needed Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviets from the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

Although congressionally chartered, it is not a government agency.\n\nThe USO was founded in 1941 in response to a request from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale and recreation services to U.S. uniformed military personnel. Roosevelt was elected as its honorary chairman. This request brought together six civilian organizations: the Salvation Army, Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA), Young Womens Christian Association (YWCA), National Catholic Community Service," National Travelers Aid Association and the National Jewish Welfare Board. They were brought together under one umbrella to support U.S. troops. Roosevelt said he wanted "these private organizations to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces." According to historian Emily Yellin"," "The government was to build the buildings and the USO was to raise private funds to carry out its main mission: boosting the morale of the military.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                          ,

EVTDESCMARNE13001;Historically: During World War II, the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) was a British clandestine body created to produce and disseminate both white and black propaganda, with the aim of damaging enemy morale and sustaining the morale of the Occupied countries.\n\nThe Executive was formed in August 1941, reporting to the Foreign Office. The staff came mostly from SO1, which had been until then the propaganda arm of the Special Operations Executive. The organisation was governed by a committee initially comprising Anthony Eden (Foreign Secretary), Brendan Bracken (Minister of Information) and Hugh Dalton (Minister of Economic Warfare), together with officials Rex Leeper, Dallas Brooks and Robert Bruce Lockhart as chairman (and later Director General). Roundell Palmer (the future 3rd Earl of Selbourne) later replaced Dalton when he was moved to become President of the Board of Trade. Ivone Kirkpatrick, an advisor to the BBC and formerly a diplomat in Berlin, also joined the committee, while Leeper left to become British Ambassador to Greece.\n\nThe main forms of propaganda were in the form of radio broadcasts and printed postcards, leaflets and documents. PWE created a number of clandestine radio stations including Gustav Siegfried Eins, Soldatensender Calais and Kurzwellesender Atlantik.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As a symbol of the U.S. military," "the Pentagon" is often used metonymically to refer to the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nThe Pentagon was designed by American architect George Bergstrom (18761955)", and built by general contractor John McShain of Philadelphia. Ground was broken for construction on September 11,1941, and the building was dedicated on January 15, 1943.\n\nThe Pentagon is a large office building, with about 6,500,000 sq ft (600,000 m2), of which 3,700,000 sq ft (340,000 m2) are used as offices. Approximately 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel work in the Pentagon. It has five sides, five floors above ground, two basement levels, and five ring corridors per floor with a total of 17.5 mi (28.2 km) of corridors. The Pentagon includes a five-acre (20,000 m2) central plaza," which is shaped like a pentagon and informally known as "ground zero"," a nickname originating during the Cold War on the presumption that it would be targeted by the Soviet Union at the outbreak of nuclear war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In that case," this would not have been the first time you would have heard my voice."

EVTDESCMARNE13005;The Battle of Brisbane was two nights of rioting between United States military personnel on one side and Australian servicemen and civilians on the other, in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city, on 2627 November 1942, during which time the two nations were allies. By the time the violence had been quelled, one Australian soldier was dead and hundreds of Australians and U.S. servicemen had been injured. News reports of these incidents were suppressed overseas, with the causes of the riot not made evident in the few newspaper reports of the event that were published within Australia.\n\nFrom 1942 until 1945 during the Pacific War, up to one million U.S. military personnel, which included around 100,000 African-Americans, were stationed at various locations throughout eastern Australia. Many U.S. personnel were stationed in and around Brisbane, which was the headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area. Brisbane found it difficult to cope as their population of 300,000 doubled to 600,000 almost overnight. The city was fortified, schools were closed, brownouts enforced, crime increased, and many families sold up and moved inland.\n\nKey contributing factors to the riots were differences in soldier pay, differing views on race, and the competitive pursuit of of the few available women in Brisbane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                   ,

EVTDESCMARNE13006;Historically: Even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis. Direct programming began approximately seven weeks after the United States's entry into World War II, with the first live broadcast to Germany," which was called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") and was transmitted on February 1"," 1942. It was introduced by "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and included the pledge: "Today", and every day from now on," we will be with you from America to talk about the war. . . . The news may be good or bad for us  We will always tell you the truth." \n\nThe Office of War Information", when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over the VOA's operations. The VOA reached an agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation to share medium-wave transmitters in Britain, and expanded into Tunis in North Africa and Palermo and Bari, Italy as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the American Broadcasting Station in Europe.\n\nAsian transmissions started with one transmitter in California in 1941, and services were expanded by adding transmitters in Hawaii and, after recapture, the Philippines.\n\nBy the end of the war, the VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They helped other soldiers board lifeboats and gave up their own life jackets when the supply ran out.

Images of women workers were widespread in the media as posters and commercial advertising were heavily used by the government to encourage women to volunteer for wartime factory service.\n\nRockwell's image of "Rosie the Riveter" received mass distribution on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on Memorial Day", May 29, 1943. His illustration features a brawny woman taking her lunch break with a rivet gun on her lap and beneath her penny loafer a copy of Hitler's manifesto," Mein Kampf. Her lunch box reads "Rosie". Viewers quickly recognized this to be "Rosie the Riveter" from the familiar song.\n\nRockwell", America's best-known popular illustrator of the day, based the pose of his 'Rosie' on that of Michelangelo's 1509 Sistine Chapel ceiling image of the prophet Isaiah. Rockwell's model was a Vermont resident, 19-year-old Mary Doyle," who was a telephone operator near where Rockwell lived. He painted his "Rosie" as a larger woman than his model", and he later phoned to apologize. The Post's cover image proved hugely popular, and the magazine loaned it to the U.S. Treasury Department for the duration of the war, for use in war bond drives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,

EVTDESCMARNE13011;The Battle of Manners Street refers to a riot involving American and New Zealand servicemen and civilians outside the Allied Services Club in Manners Street, Wellington, New Zealand in 1943. The club was a social centre, open to all military personnel.\n\nIn 1942-44 there were anywhere between 15,000 and 45,000 American servicemen stationed in New Zealand, most camped around major urban centers of the country. Many of the American servicemen were coming from major American urban centers to New Zealand, which in 1943 was an isolated country with only 1.6 million inhabitants or about the population of Detroit, Michigan.\n\nSome of the servicemen from the American South objected to Maori soldiers using the Club, and on 3 April 1943 began stopping Maori soldiers from entering. Many New Zealand soldiers were in the area, both Caucasian (Pakeha) and Maori, and combined in opposition. The stand off escalated when Americans took off their belts to attack those who wanted to let the Maori in. Fights broke out and at one point at least a 1,000 men were involved in the subsequent fracas, which was broken up by civil and military police. The major brawl lasted from 6-8 pm, with some brawls lasting for perhaps another two hours. Dozens of people were injured.\n\nNews of the riot was censored at the time, hence much of the mythology about the event, including the claim that two Americans were killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The U.S. Navy maintains that no such experiment was ever conducted", that the details of the story contradict well-established facts about the USS Eldridge, and that the alleged claims do not conform to known physical laws.\n\nThe experiment was allegedly based on an aspect of some unified field theory, a term coined by Albert Einstein to describe a class of potential theories. Such theories would aim to describe - mathematically and physically - the interrelated nature of the forces that comprise electromagnetic radiation and gravity, in other words, uniting the fields of electromagnetism and gravity into a single field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,

Having been the only Hollywood film-maker to continue to make silent films well into the period of sound films, this was Chaplin's first true talking picture.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring, controversial condemnation of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, fascism, antisemitism, and the Nazis. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with Nazi Germany. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator, and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\nThe Great Dictator was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film. Modern critics have also praised it as a historically significant film and an important work of satire. The Great Dictator was nominated for five Academy Awards.\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In both cases the board's purpose was to arbitrate disputes between workers and employers in order to ensure labor reliability and productivity during the war.\n\nThe NWLB was reestablished by President Roosevelt on January 12,1942, under the chairmanship of William Hammatt Davis. It became a tripartite body and was charged with acting as an arbitration tribunal in labor-management dispute cases, thereby preventing work stoppages which might hinder the war effort. It administered wage control in national industries such as automobiles, shipping, railways, airlines, telegraph lines, and mining.\n\nThe Board was originally divided into twelve Regional Administrative Boards which handled both labor dispute settlement and wage stabilization functions for specific geographic regions. The National Board further decentralized in 1943, when it established special tripartite commissions and panels to deal with specific industries on a national base.\n\nIt ceased operating on December 31,1945, some four months after the war's close.

"The present great struggle has taught us increasingly that freedom of person and security of property anywhere in the world depend upon the security of the rights and obligations of liberty and justice everywhere in the world. This war is a new kind of war. It is different from all other wars of the past", not only in its methods and weapons but also in its geography. It is warfare in terms of every continent, every island, every sea, every air-lane in the world.\n...\nIf a just and durable peace is to be attained, or even if all of us are merely to save our own skins, there is one thought for us here at home to keep uppermost -- the fulfillment of our special task of production --uninterrupted production. I stress that word 'uninterrupted.' Germany, Italy and Japan are very close to their maximum output of planes, guns, tanks and ships. The United Nations are not -- especially the United States of America. Our first job then is to build up production -- uninterrupted production -- so that the United Nations can maintain control of the seas and attain control of the air -- not merely a slight superiority, but an overwhelming superiority.\n...\nThis generation of Americans has come to realize, with a present and personal realization, that there is something larger and more important than the life of any individual or of any individual group -- something for which a man will sacrifice, and gladly sacrifice, not only his pleasures, not only his goods, not only his associations with those he loves, but his life itself. In time of crisis when the future is in the balance, we come to understand, with full recognition and devotion," what this nation is and what we owe to it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                   ,

She was carrying American mail to Iceland. She was flying the American flag. Her identity as an American ship was unmistakable.  She was then and there attacked by a submarine. Germany admits that it was a German submarine. The submarine deliberately fired a torpedo at the GREER, followed later by another torpedo attack.

EVTDESCMARNE13035;The sudden criminal attacks perpetrated by the Japanese in the Pacific provide the climax of a decade of international immorality. Powerful and resourceful gangsters have banded together to make war upon the whole human race. Their challenge has now been flung at the United States of America. The Japanese have treacherously violated the longstanding peace between us. Many American soldiers and sailors have been killed by enemy action. American ships have been sunk. American airplanes have been destroyed.\n\nThe Congress and the people of the United States have accepted that challenge.\n\nThe true goal we seek is far above and beyond the ugly field of battle. When we resort to force, as now we must, we are determined that this force shall be directed toward ultimate good as well as against immediate evil. We Americans are not destroyers -- we are builders.\n\nWe are now in the midst of a war, not for conquest, not for vengeance, but for a world in which this nation, and all that this nation represents, will be safe for our children.

EVTDESCMARNE13036;On the Progress of the War:\n\nIn this global war there are now four main areas of combat: The Russian Front, The Pacific Ocean area, the Mediterranean and Middle East area, and the European Front.\n\nThere are at least a dozen different points at which attacks can be launched. I will not give details of future plans, but you can rest assured that preparations are being made here and in Britain toward this purpose. The power of Germany must be broken.\n\nVarious people urge that we concentrate our forces on one or another of these four areas, although no one suggests that any one of the four areas should be abandoned. Certainly, it could not be seriously urged that we abandon aid to Russia, or that we surrender all of the Pacific to Japan, or the Mediterranean and Middle East to Germany, or give up an offensive against Germany. The American people may be sure that we shall neglect none of the four great theaters of war.\n\n Several thousand Americans have met death in battle. Other thousands will lose their lives. But many millions stand ready to step into their places -- to engage in a struggle to the very death. For they know that the enemy is determined to destroy us," our homes and our institutions -- that in this war it is kill or be killed.This is the toughest war of all time. We need not leave it to historians of the future to answer the question whether we are tough enough to meet this unprecedented challenge. We can give that answer now.

The main thing that I observed on this trip is not exactly news. It is the plain fact that the American people are united as never before in their determination to do a job and to do it well.\n\nThis whole nation of one hundred and thirty million free men, women and children is becoming one great fighting force. Some of us are soldiers or sailors, some of us are civilians. Some of us are fighting the war in airplanes five miles above the continent of Europe or the islands of the Pacific -- and some of us are fighting it in mines deep doom in the earth of Pennsylvania or Montana. A few of us are decorated with medals for heroic achievement, but all of us can have that deep and permanent inner satisfaction that comes from doing the best we know how -- each of us playing an honorable part in the great struggle to save our democratic civilization.\n\n...\n\nThe objective of today is clear and realistic. It is to destroy completely the military power of Germany, Italy and Japan to such good purpose that their threat against us and all the other United Nations cannot be revived a generation hence.

The story of Rome goes back to the time of the foundations of our civilization. We can still see there monuments of the time when Rome and the Romans controlled the whole of the then known world. That, too, is significant, for the United Nations are determined that in the future no one city and no one race will be able to control the whole of the world.\n\nNo great effort like this can be a hundred percent perfect, but the batting average is very, very high.\n\nAnd so I extend the congratulations and thanks tonight of the American people to General Alexander, who has been in command of the whole Italian operation, to our General Clark and General Leese of the Fifth and the Eighth Armies, to General Wilson, the Supreme Allied commander of the Mediterranean theater, to (and) General Devers his American Deputy, to (Lieutenant) General Eaker, to Admirals Cunningham and Hewitt, and to all their brave officers and men.\n\nMay God bless them and watch over them and over all of our gallant, fighting men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

Before Toyoshima's crash, only nine Zeros had been shot down in the Pearl Harbor attack, 74 days before the first Air Raid on Darwin; their pilots had died, and the badly damaged wrecks were of little use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Across Canada", 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Throughout 1942, the need for combat crew personnel far exceeded the current and contemplated production of the commands flying training schools.

EVTNAME88158;RAF Bomber Command begins new strategic campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88158;"The decision to begin a new spell of intensive operations against Germany was conveyed to Bomber Command on 14th February", 1942. This directive was six days old when Air Marshal A.T. Harris succeeded Sir Richard Peirse at High Wycombe.  Nevertheless, by the time of his appointment to command the bomber force, Harris had in fact come to some very firm conclusions.  With the means available, attempts to win the war by bombing what he termed Panacea targets were doomed to failure.  Oil plants, aircraft works, ball-bearing factories, molybdenum mines, submarine yards, and the like, even if our bombers could find and hit them, their destruction would probably have nothing like the effect prophesied by our economic experts.  And, as for the most part, such targets could not be found and hit by night.  And as our bombers could certainly not survive over Germany by day," it followed that our offensive must be directed against something much larger.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTNAME88159;Operation MILLENNIUM;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88159;On 30th May Harris scraped together every last available plane, including training aircraft, and sent 1,000 bombers on a huge night raid to Cologne.  Had it gone wrong, Bomber Commands campaign could have been finished.  But the German defences were overwhelmed by the seemingly endless waves of bombers and the first Thousand Bomber Raid was a huge success.  The aircrews' morale soared as did confidence in Bomber Command.  Another two 1,000 bomber raids quickly followed and Harris' Bomber Offensive had begun.  For three-and-a-half years Bomber Command pounded Germany night after night, sometimes sending 800 or more aircraft against a major industrial centre.  Sometimes, if weather conditions precluded a heavy raid, sending a few fast Mosquitoes over Berlin or the Ruhr industrial area to keep the air raid sirens sounding all night and German war workers out of their beds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME88160;Operation Chastise - Dam Busters Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88160;"Bomber Command was called upon to fly many unusual and particularly dangerous missions.  These included the famous Dambusters raid on 16-17"," May 1943.   The challenge was to fly Lancaster bombers very low across Holland into Germany at night and drop the special "bouncing bombs", designed by Barnes Wallis, at just 60 ft over water towards the huge Mohne and Eder dams in the Ruhr valley. The specialist 617 squadron was formed and trained for six weeks for the operation.  Both dams were destroyed and a third was damaged, though of the 19 bombers involved, 8 were lost.  The raids leader, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, received the Victoria Cross.\n\nThe raid was an extraordinary demonstration of precision bombing at night and the skill of the airmen was admired even by the Germans.  Although the resulting flooding did not cause as much damage as was hoped," Bomber Commands achievement had enormous propaganda value as pictures of the broken dams were flashed around the world.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTDESC91800;Aircraft and midget submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy have began an attack on the US.  Contrary to popular belief, these attacks were not a surprise.  The Americans had deciphered Japan's code earlier and knew about a planned attack before it actually occurred.  However, due to difficulty in deciphering intercepted messages, the Americans failed to discover Japan's target location before the attack occurred.  Under the command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the attack was devastating in loss of life and damage to the U.S. fleet.\n\nAt 6:05 a.m. on December 7, the six Japanese carriers launched a first wave of 183 planes composed mainly of dive bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters.  The Japanese hit American ships and military installations at 7:51 am.  The first wave attacked military airfields of Ford Island.  At 8:30 a.m. a second wave of 170 Japanese planes, mostly torpedo bombers, attacked the fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME89002;Operation ULTRA;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC89002;"ULTRA was the name used by the British for intelligence resulting from decryption of encrypted German radio communications in World War II. The term eventually became the standard designation for all intelligence from high-level cryptanalytic sources.  The name arose because the code-breaking was considered more important than the highest security classification available at the time", (Most Secret), and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.  Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine," hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park", codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war," though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.  We will gain a decrypt against Germany.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTDESC89004;"Military Intelligence section 6 (MI6) the UK's foreign intelligence agency", weeks before the outbreak of World War II, in Warsaw, Poland's Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau) revealed its achievements in decrypting German Enigma ciphers to French and British intelligence.  The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected," and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house", its stables and cottages. These proved too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school," was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma machine," but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German Fish High Command teleprinter cyphers.  The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named "Ultra".  It contributed greatly to the Allied success in defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic"," and to the British naval victories of the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of North Cape.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                           ,

Most significantly, Victor Emmanuel had demanded neutrality in the dispute.

Zhukov had been massing a major armored force in the form of three tank brigades (the 4th, 6th and 11th), and two mechanized brigades (7th and 8th).  The Kwantung Army, by contrast, mustered only two lightly-armed divisions at the point of attack, built around Lieutenant General Michitaro Komatsubara's 23rd Division whose headquarters had been at Hailar, capital of Hsingan, Manchu province, over 150 km from the site of the fighting.  Their intelligence had also failed to detect the scale of the Soviet buildup or the scope of the attack Zhukov was planning.\n\nZhukov decided it was time to break the stalemate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,

This was canceled when a cease-fire was signed in Moscow.  When Zhukov completed the annihilation of the 23rd division, great events were taking place thousands of kilometers to the west.\n\nThe very next day, on 1 September 1939, Adolf Hitler launched his invasion of Poland and World War II broke out in Europe.  The Soviets had already agreed to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which called for the Soviet Union to occupy eastern Poland and establish spheres of influence in Finland, Latvia, and Estonia.

Stalin, probably with a liking for the irony," thought that the only General in his army to have survived two and a half years of his gulag would be perfect to lead his penal army.

For example Lose Stalin or Hitler and suffer major national unity and revolt risk increase. As the mod develops more political leaders will have events based around them. For now the unit is a useful last ditch defensive formation useful for siege battles. It is moved via strategic deployment or aircraft. The AI will combine them with an Army Group or theatre HQ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14745;The Battle Commander unit represents an important General. this unit can be used to trun the tide in a battle and provide abit of extra flavour to a command.

EVTDESC49094;BlackICE uses a different build to HOI3 and mods. It helps to think of brigades as components. A tank division might have a tank component, infantry component + supports. The main components are more powerful and expensive with long build times. The supports are cheaper to build. So the old 3 main + support is not advised. A player should build 2 main + 2 supports div (eg Arm+Mot+TD+AC). The AI builds 1 main + 3 supports. This means the AI can build a large amount of division sized assets. Giving it more flexibility in its use and ability to take advantage of opportunities. This type of division tends to shatter faster in long battles. These divisions need a large reserve of fresh units to be rotated into the battle. In addition shattered units will reform at the theatre HQ  giving the AI a strategic reserve. If a player intends to give control of his armies to the AI, this method of division construction can be effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC49184;Terrain and Weather in Black ICE are much more pronounced than vanilla. Bad terrain, bad weather combined can reduce all movement to zero. In such situations sometimes the only thing to do is wait for the weather to clear. Movement speed and ETA is calculated on an hourly basis, so a long ETA and no speed will reset once the weather clears. In addition different units are affected differently by terrain in a more pronounced way. Tanks will bog down badly in marshes. A tank unit forced to retreat into a marsh is going to be out of the war for a long time. In this sense a certain amount of planning is required when conducting warfare in difficult terrain. Each unit will list its bonuses or penalties for each terrain type. It is well worth taking time to find out which units will fight best in a given terrain. E.g, Light Infantry, Marines, Engineers, Pack Artillery and Commandoes are the best units to send into Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC49088;This is a small elite formation based around a skilled General. It can be added to a division as a powerful force multiplier and adds a special forces CA bonus. Some nations will have a number in the starting OOB, but only the a.i. is allowed to keep them. You will get an event that deletes all Battle Commanders.  You can keep up to three of them at a severe cost in officers. As the game progresses you may get historical events granting you additional Battle Commanders for a price in officers. There is a third possibility to get Battle Commanders: If your army achieves a major victory there is a chance of creating a new Battle Commander. This unit will appear in your construction queue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                             ,
EVTDESC49089;"In the nation tab of the technology screen you find this new tech. For every level of research you get access to an additional project. When you receive a new economic boost event and choose Use the opportunity for big business!  Each new project is then activated via a decisions notification. Each project will give a new Strategic Effect (have a look at your SE screen) and can trigger additional events in the later game. It is wise to choose carefully as some projects may not be suitable for your nation or strategy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTDESC49091;"You can now purchase these special buildings via event. These events will trigger upon meeting certain conditions. For example a level 10 port is one condition needed to purchase dockyard facilities. You will also need a very large amount of resources", money," and supplies. After purchasing the new building there may be a wait of between 6 months to 2 years whilst it is built. Strategic Resources can also combine to give new Strategic Effects. For example Horses and Black Soil will give the Agricultural Giant strategic effect.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTDESC49090;In the nation tab of the technology screen you find this new tech. For every level of research you get access to one additional monumental building. If you have the required resources you can initiate the construction of a new monumental building via a decision. Each monumental building will give a new Strategic Effect and give can trigger additional events in the later game. For example you can construct research labs, once you are at war and have built the Imperial University. But be aware that all of these building are related to your capital. If your capital falls the benefits will cease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                             ,
EVTDESC49092;"Broadcasting is one of the new nation techs. For every level of research you get access to an additional component of the broadcasting programme. If you have enough money you can activate every new component via a decision. Every programme will give a new Strategic Effect (have a look at your SE screen). Another new tech is the Secretary of public information and education. There are different areas of policy which cause random events to fire. These events will give negative modifiers for some time"," but you can choose to have the Secretary attempt to control the situation. The higher the tech level the better his chance of success. Each attempt will cost money and if he fails the negative modifier can even last longer. Once he has success this situation wont occur again and will gain a new strategic effect. Depending on the number of battle fought and his level you may get a penalty.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                             ,
EVTDESC49093;Many new features of Black ICE need money, which can become tight. War bonds are a new source for your treasury. Its simple and fast way to generate a large amount of money, but have some negative side effects to the states stability. The higher the IC the more money will generate from war bonds. If you have constructed the Imperial Finance-Ministry you get even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC49196;One of the new challenges in Black ICE is the constant need to keep your population content along with managing any captured populations. Choosing to enable revolts will allow your own people to riot and shut down entire cities. You will need to send in the military to control the unrest. To this end the major nations all receive a strong policing force via event in the areas where riots and unrest are most likely to occur. The best way of managing this part of the game is to set up a new theatre with the policing units and define the entire area behind the frontlines and borders. Set this on full AI control along with militia, garrisons, cavalry, fascist militia, NKVD and any spare army troops.The larger the area the more troops you will need;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC49197;The scale of airforce units is smaller in Black ICE. Each airforce unit represents something closer to a number of squadrons. This means that both the AI and the player will need to build and deploy much larger airforces. The key to gaining air control is to field a large interceptor force.an idea of how large can be seen in the Soviet airforce by 1941 often having approx. 200 interceptors alone. To maintain a large airforce you will also need to build more airfields and have an effective command and control. Developing a strong airforce command chain makes managing your airforce much easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC49183;Combined arms brigades are historical event triggered formations which form on the map when specific historical triggers are met. This typically will be the capture(or loss) of a certain province. The unit represents a rare and powerful combined arms mobile formation led by a historical leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC49199;Black ICE uses a different build structure to vanilla HOI3 and mods.Main brigades are more expensive and powerful. The AI uses a single main brigade and 3 suppoort units. One postitive of this is allowing the AI to have many more divisional assets to spread around the battlefield. This leaves the player facing a much more numerous enemy ready to launch more battles across mutiple fronts. .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC49200;The Economic war in Black ICE is expanded upon and given more options thanks to new event choices such as the yearly National Focus event, various money trading events and a range of new strategic effects, techs and country modifiers.

Murphy sent all of the remaining men to the rear while he shot at the Germans with his M1 carbine until he ran out of ammunition. He then climbed aboard an abandoned, burning M10 tank destroyer and used its .50 caliber machine gun to cut down the German infantry, including one full squad of German infantry who crawled in a ditch to within 100 feet (30 m) of his position. He was able to call in artillery fire using a land-line telephone and, under heavy fire, was wounded in the leg. He nonetheless continued his nearly single-handed battle for almost an hour.

This month-long battle included some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the War in the Pacific of World War II.\n\nIwo Jima was also the only battle by the U.S. Marine Corps in which the overall American casualties (killed and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese, although Japanese combat deaths were thrice those of the Americans. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 of these were taken prisoner.

EVTNAMEMARNE0008;The Battle of Monte Cassino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0008;The Battle of Monte Cassino was a costly series of four assaults by the Allies against the Winter Line in Italy held by the Germans and Italians during World War II. The intention was a breakthrough to Rome.\n\nAt the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido, Liri and Garigliano valleys and some of the surrounding peaks and ridges. Together, these features formed the Gustav Line. Monte Cassino, a historic hilltop abbey founded in AD 529 by Benedict of Nursia, dominated the nearby town of Cassino and the entrances to the Liri and Rapido valleys, but had been left unoccupied by the German defenders. The Germans had, however, manned some positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey's walls.\n\nFearing that the abbey did form part of the Germans' defensive line, primarily as a lookout post, the Allies sanctioned its bombing and American bombers proceeded to drop 1,400 tons of bombs onto it. The destruction and rubble left by the bombing raid now provided better protection from aerial and artillery attacks, so, two days later, German paratroopers took up positions in the abbey's ruins. Between 17 January and 18 May, Monte Cassino and the Gustav defences were assaulted four times by Allied troops, the last involving twenty divisions attacking along a twenty-mile front. The German defenders were finally driven from their positions, but at a high cost.\n\nThe Allies suffered around 55,000 casualties in the Monte Cassino campaign. German casualty figures are estimated at around 20,000 killed and wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                    ,

EVTDESCMARNE0009A;"In order to set up forward air bases capable of supporting operations across the mid-Pacific", to the Philippines, and into Japan, the U.S. needed to take the Marianas Islands. The Marianas were heavily defended. Naval doctrine of the time held that in order for attacks to succeed, land-based aircraft would be required to weaken defenses and provide some measure of protection for the invasion forces. The nearest islands capable of supporting such an effort were the Marshall Islands, northeast of Guadalcanal. Taking the Marshalls would provide the base needed to launch an offensive on the Marianas but the Marshalls were cut off from direct communications with Hawaii by a garrison and air base on the small island of Betio, on the western side of Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. Thus, to eventually launch an invasion of the Marianas, the battles had to start far to the east, at Tarawa.\n\nThe Japanese were keenly aware of the vulnerability of the Gilbert Islands. They captured and fortified Tarawa in an effort to slow the Americans in the Pacific.\n\nJapanese General Shibazaki continued the defensive preparations right up to the day of the invasion. He encouraged his troops," saying it would take one million men one hundred years to conquer Tarawa.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

It was the first American offensive in the critical central Pacific region.\n\nIt was also the first time in the war that the United States faced serious Japanese opposition to an amphibious landing. Previous landings met little or no initial resistance. The 4,500 Japanese defenders were well-supplied and well-prepared, and they fought almost to the last man, exacting a heavy toll on the United States Marine Corps. The US had suffered similar casualties in other campaigns, for example over the six months in the campaign for Guadalcanal, but in this case the losses were suffered within the space of 76 hours. Nearly 6,000 Japanese and Americans died on the tiny island in the fighting.\n\nLast week some 2,000 or 3,000 United States Marines, most of them now dead or wounded, gave the nation a name to stand beside those of Concord Bridge, the Bon Homme Richard, the Alamo, Little Big Horn, and Belleau Wood.

However, due to Japan's well-crafted fortifications and stiff resistance, the battle lasted over two months. In the United States, it was a controversial battle because of the island's questionable strategic value and the high casualty rate," which was the highest for U.S. military personnel of any battle in the Pacific War.

The 82-day-long battle lasted from early April until mid-June 1945. After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were approaching Japan, and planned to use Okinawa, a large island only 340 mi (550 km) away from mainland Japan, as a base for air operations on the planned invasion of Japanese mainland (coded Operation Downfall). Four divisions of the U.S. 10th Army (the 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th) and two Marine Divisions (the 1st and 6th) fought on the island while the 2nd Marine Division remained as an amphibious reserve and was never brought ashore. The invasion was supported by naval, amphibious, and tactical air forces.\n\nThe battle has been referred to as the Typhoon of Steel in English. The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of kamikaze attacks from the Japanese defenders, and to the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle resulted in the highest number of casualties in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Japan lost over 100,000 soldiers, who were either killed, captured or committed suicide, and the Allies suffered more than 65,000 casualties of all kinds. Simultaneously, tens of thousands of local civilians were killed, wounded," or committed suicide.

However, they were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P-39 Airacobras (March 1944), later with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts (JuneJuly 1944), and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated, the North American P-51 Mustang. When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47s and later, P-51s, red, the nickname Red Tails was coined.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen flew 1378 combat missions during WWII, and scored 112 enemy aircraft destroyed in the air, and another 150 on the ground.

EVTDESCMARNE0025A;The largest land mass in the Solomon Islands chain, the tropical island of Guadalcanal will give the Japanese a key advantage in the war.

EVTNAMEMARNE0025;The Battle of Guadalcanal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0025;On August 7,1942, Allied forces, predominantly American, landed on the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. The Allies also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The Allies overwhelmed the outnumbered Japanese defenders, who had occupied the islands since May 1942, and captured Tulagi and Florida, as well as an airfield (later named Henderson Field) that was under construction on Guadalcanal. Powerful U.S. naval forces supported the landings.\n\nThe Guadalcanal campaign was a significant strategic combined arms victory by Allied forces over the Japanese in the Pacific theatre. The Japanese had reached the high-water mark of their conquests in the Pacific, and Guadalcanal marked the transition by the Allies from defensive operations to the strategic offensive in that theatre and the beginning of offensive operations, including the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Central Pacific campaigns, that resulted in Japan's eventual surrender and the end of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE0026;The Battle for Kwajalein;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0026;The Battle of Kwajalein was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought from 31 January-3 February 1944, on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Employing the hard-learned lessons of the battle of Tarawa, the United States launched a successful twin assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north. The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance though outnumbered and under-prepared. The determined defense of Roi-Namur left only 51 survivors of an original garrison of 3,500.\n\nFor the U.S., the battle represented both the next step in its island-hopping march to Japan and a significant moral victory because it was the first time the U.S. penetrated the outer ring of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defense. Japanese defenses became prepared in depth, and the battles of Peleliu, Guam," and the Marianas proved far more costly to the U.S.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                         ,

EVTNAMEMARNE0027;The Battle for Eniwetok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0027;The campaign in the Marshalls was a necessary stepping stone in the battle for the Central Pacific. Eniwetok was a central target, with 3,500 Japanese and Korean defenders. Landings were made on February 18, 1944.\n\nThe Americans moved with air, sea and land coordination, and used the tactics they developed under fire at Tarawa. Battleships moved to within 1,500 yards of the shore to fire on Japanese positions. A combined force of US Army and US Marines landed and began moving behind massed artillery barrages.\n\nWithin six days, the Americans had cleared the island, again taking few prisoners. Most of the 3500 defenders were dead, and the Americans took 348 casualties.\n\nEniwetok's airfield, Engebi, and airfields on Kwajalein allowed the Marshalls to be dominated by air, rendering further landings unnecessary.\n\nAfter the war, Eniwetok, now Enewetak, became the test ground for the first US hydrogen bomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

EVTNAMEMARNE0028;The Battle for Saipan and Tinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0028;The Battle of Saipan was fought between June 15th and July 7th 1944. Saipan held huge strategic importance for both the Japanese and Americans. Saipan was part of the Mariana Islands and its capture would allow the Americans to build runways big enough for its B29 Superfortress bombers to reach mainland Japan and return to their base in Saipan. It also meant that any Japanese forces south of Saipan were cut off from the Japanese mainland itself. The Americans wanted to capture Saipan at all costs but the Japanese, equally aware of its importance, were also prepared to defend the island to the death. The Battle of Saipan proved to be very bloody.\n\nAn amphibious landing on the island was preceded by an intense two-day bombardment carried out by the US Navy. Over 165,000 shells were fired at Japanese positions on the beaches that the Marines were going to land on. The first landings on Saipan took place at 07.00 and by 09.00,8,000 US Marines were ashore. However, they had to fight every inch of the way as the Japanese defenders had placed barbed wire just behind the beaches along with trenches and machine gun posts.\n\nSaipan was declared secure on July 9th. Nearly 30,000 Japanese soldiers had died trying to defend the island. 3,426 Americans were killed with 13,000 wounded  fractionally fewer than 25% of the 71,000 US soldiers who landed on Saipan. A small group of Japanese soldiers held out in the mountains until December 1945 when they finally accepted that not only the battle but also the war had been lost.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE0029A;The Japanese Have Taken Over Guam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0029A;A territory of the United States since the end of the Spanish-American War of 1898, Guam was a small Pacific island under the control of the American military at the time of its attack. Like Wake Island, Naval leadership believed that the defense of Guam was neither feasible nor necessary. In 1938, requests to fortify the island were denied due to what was seen as low importance in regards to other American territory in the area, as well as limitations originating from the Washington Naval Conference. After brave but token resistance on the part of a small garrison of Marines and the native Guam Insular Force, armed only with antiquated rifles and pistols, Capt. George McMillin, acting governor of the island, surrendered it on 10 December.\n\nJapanese plans for the Pacific War included capturing Guam within the war's first days. From March 1941 Japanese aircraft flew photo reconnaissance sorties over the island. Plans for the invasion of the island were completed in September that year, and the South Seas Detachment was selected as the main unit responsible for this. The South Seas Detachment comprised the 144th Infantry Regiment and other units detached from the 55th Division and had a strength of 4,886 men. The South Seas Detachment was concentrated in Korea during November 1941 and, following a brief stay in Japan, sailed for Chichi-jima in the Bonin Islands late that month.\n\nWith Guam in Japanese hands, we are no closer to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,

EVTDESCMARNE0032;"Mr. President", after careful consideration," we believe that our best strategy at this point is a leapfrogging or "island hopping" approach", whereby we bypass heavily fortified Japanese positions and instead concentrate our limited resources on strategically important islands that are not well defended but capable of supporting the drive to the main islands of Japan.\n\nLeapfrogging will offer a number of advantages. It will allow our forces to reach Japan more quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. It will also afford us with the advantage of surprise and keep the Japanese off balance.\n\nOne other thing, sir.  As we secure certain islands, special elite historical units will be made available to our commanders in the field via a staging area in Honolulu.  Additionally, our citizens will become more and more inspired, affording us with boosts to our economy, basing efficiency, and the like.\n\nWe await your orders," Mr. President.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

Initially called the Swashbucklers, they participated in the Solomon Islands campaign, flying out of Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. They were disbanded following their combat tour and the squadron designation was given to the Marine command on Espiritu Santo.\n\nIn August 1943," a group of twenty-seven young men under the leadership of Major Gregory "Pappy" Boyington (who was later awarded the Medal of Honor) were joined together to form the original "Blacksheep" of VMF-214. Major Boyington had just returned from a year's tour in China as a member of the 1st American Volunteer Group (nicknamed the Flying Tigers)", and had been credited with multiple kills of Japanese aircraft. The squadron was not assigned any aircraft or ancillary personnel at first and flew to Guadalcanal and later the Russell Islands in borrowed planes that were in less than satisfactory condition.\n\nThe Black Sheep squadron fought for eighty-four days. They met the Japanese over their own fields and territory and piled up a record of 203 planes destroyed or damaged, produced nine fighter aces with 97 confirmed air-to-air kills, sank several troop transports and supply ships, destroyed many installations, in addition to numerous other victories. For their actions," the original Black Sheep were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism in action.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

The unit became famous for its deep-penetration missions behind Japanese lines, often engaging Japanese forces superior in number.\n\nIn slightly more than five months of combat, the Marauders had advanced 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in 5 major engagements (Walawbum, Shaduzup, Inkangahtawng, Nhpum Ga, and Myitkyina) and engaged in combat with the Japanese Army on thirty-two separate occasions, including two conventional defensive battles with enemy forces for which the force had not been intended nor equipped. Battling Japanese soldiers, hunger, fevers, and disease, they had traversed more jungle terrain on their long-range missions than any other U.S. Army formation during World War II.\n\nThe men of the Merrill's Marauders enjoyed the rare distinction of having each soldier awarded the Bronze Star.

It was fought on and around the atoll formed by Wake Island and its islets of Peale and Wilkes Islands by the air, land and naval forces of the Empire of Japan against those of the U.S., with Marines playing a prominent role on both sides. The island was held by the Japanese until September 4,1945, when the remaining Japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of United States Marines.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE0036;We have re-taken Wake Island, Mr. President!\n\nHistorically, Wake Island was occasionally raided, but never en masses.\n\nFearing an imminent invasion, the Japanese reinforced Wake Island with more formidable defenses. The American captives were ordered to build a series of bunkers and fortifications on Wake. The Japanese brought in an 8 inch (200 mm) naval artillery gun that they had captured in Singapore. The U.S. Navy established a submarine blockade instead of an amphibious invasion on Wake Island. As a result, the Japanese garrison starved which led to the extinction of an endemic bird. On 24 February 1942, aircraft from the carrier Enterprise attacked the Japanese garrison on Wake Island. U.S. forces bombed the island periodically from 1942 until Japans surrender in 1945. On 24 July 1943, B-24 Liberators led by Lieutenant Jesse Stay of the 42nd Squadron (11th Bombardment Group) of the U.S. Army Air Forces, in transit from Midway Island, struck the Japanese garrison on Wake Island. At least 2 men from that raid were awarded Distinguished Flying Crosses for their efforts. Future President George H. W.

The unit is best known for its role in liberating American prisoners of war (POWs) from the Japanese Cabanatuan POW camp near Cabanatuan, Philippines in Jan 1945.\n\nThe Scouts were organized on Fergusson Island, New Guinea, on 28 November 1943. Their purpose was to conduct recon and raider work in the Southwest Pacific Theater. They were under the personal command of Lt. General Walter Krueger, Commanding General of the U.S. Sixth Army.\n\nKrueger sought to create an all volunteer elite unit consisting of small teams which could operate deep behind enemy lines. Their primary mission was to gather intelligence for the 6th U.S. Army. The unit was so named because of Krueger's association with San Antonio, Texas and because of his admiration for the defenders of the Alamo.\n\nIn the Scouts' first two years of operation they were credited with liberating 197 Allied prisoners in New Guinea. In January 1945 they provided tactical support for the 6th Ranger Battalion during the raid of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp. The Scouts were credited with the capture of 84 Japanese prisoners of war, and only two Scouts were wounded in the mission.\n\nThe Alamo Scouts performed 106 known missions behind enemy lines, mainly in New Guinea and the Philippines without losing a single man.

EVTNAMEMARNE0062;Wake is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0062;"Historically: On December 8",1941, the day of the Attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7 in Hawaii, which is on the other side of the International Date Line), at least 27 Japanese Mitsubishi G3M medium Nell bombers flown from bases on Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands attacked Wake Island, destroying eight of the 12 F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft belonging to United States Marine Corps Fighter Squadron 211 (VMF-211) on the ground. The Marine garrison's defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid, which primarily targeted the aircraft.\n\nThe garrison  supplemented by civilian volunteers  repelled several Japanese landing attempts. An American journalist reported that after the initial Japanese amphibious assault was beaten back with heavy losses on December 11, the American commander was asked by his superiors if he needed anything. The commander sent back the message," "Send us more Japs!"  a reply which became a popular legend.\n\nDenied support from Hawaii", the isolated U.S. garrison was eventually overwhelmed by a reinforced and greatly superior Japanese invasion force on December 23. American casualties numbered 52 military personnel (Navy and Marine) and approximately 70 civilians killed. Japanese losses exceeded 700 dead, with some estimates ranging as high as 1,000. Wake's defenders sank two Japanese destroyers and one submarine, and shot down 24 Japanese aircraft.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, most of the captured civilians and military personnel were sent to POW camps in Asia," though some of the civilian laborers were enslaved by the Japanese and tasked with improving the island's defenses.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTNAMEMARNE0063;Midway has been lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0063;Historically: The location of Midway in the Pacific became important to the military. Midway was a convenient refueling stop on transpacific flights, and was also an important stop for Navy ships. Beginning in 1940, as tensions with the Japanese were rising, Midway was deemed second only to Pearl Harbor in importance to protecting the U.S. west coast. Airstrips, gun emplacements and a seaplane base quickly materialized on the tiny atoll. The channel was widened, and Naval Air Station Midway was completed. Architect Albert Kahn designed the Officer's quarters, the mall and several other hangars and buildings. Midway was also an important submarine base. Midway's importance to the U.S. was brought into focus on December 7, 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Midway was attacked for the first time on December 7,1941, and the Japanese force was successfully repulsed in the first American victory of the war. A Japanese submarine bombarded Midway on February 10, 1942. Four months later, on June 4,1942, a naval battle near Midway resulted in the U.S. Navy exacting a devastating defeat of the Japanese Navy. Four Japanese fleet aircraft carriers, the Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu and Soryu, were sunk, along with the loss of hundreds of Japanese aircraft, losses that the Japanese would never be able to replace. The U.S. lost the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-5), along with a number of its carrier- and land-based aircraft that were either shot down by Japanese forces or bombed on the ground at the airfields. The Battle of Midway was, by most accounts, the beginning of the end of the Japanese Navy's control of the Pacific Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE0064;Midway is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE0065;"Sir", our central base of operations in the Pacific has been lost to the Americans. Given the importance of the naval base and airfields there, we must take it back!\n\nHistorically: During World War II, Truk Lagoon was the Empire of Japan's main base in the South Pacific theatre. The Japanese garrison consisted of 27,856 IJN men under the command of Vice Admiral Masami Kobayashi then Vice Admiral Chuichi Hara and 16,737 IJA men under the command of Major General Kanenobu Ishuin. A significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based there, with its administrative center on Tonoas (south of Weno). Truk was the base for Japanese operations against Allied forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Due to its heavy fortifications, both natural and manmade, the base at Truk was known to Allied forces as the Gibraltar of the Pacific. Operation Hailstone, executed by the United States in 1944, culminated in one of the most important naval airstrikes of the war at Truk. Twelve Japanese warships, thirty-two merchant ships and 249 aircraft were destroyed," although the larger warships had moved to Palau a week earlier.\n\nThe attacks for the most part ended Truk as a major threat to Allied operations in the central Pacific.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTNAMEMARNE0071;Schmeling KO's Louis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0071;The first fight between Louis and Schmeling took place on June 19,1936, at the famous Yankee Stadium in New York, New York. The referee was the legendary Arthur Donovan, and the stadium's seats were sold out. The bout was scheduled for fifteen rounds.\n\nSchmeling had studied Louis' style, and in the days before the fight, he claimed to have found the key to victory - fans thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.\n\nSchmeling spent the first three rounds using his jab, while sneaking his right cross behind his jab. Louis was stunned by his rival's style. In the fourth round, a snapping right landed on Louis' chin, and Louis was sent to the canvas for the first time in his twenty eight professional fights. As the fight progressed, stunned fans and critics alike watched Schmeling continue to use this style effectively, and Louis apparently had no idea how to solve the puzzle.\n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible.\n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                  ,
EVTNAMEMARNE0072;Chaplin's Modern Times;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0072;"Modern Times is a 1936 comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern", industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization.\n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first talkie, and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However," he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of the Tramp would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTNAMEMARNE0073;The Fighting Seabees;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0073;"With the onset of WWII", there was an immediate need for overseas bases, and civilian workers could not be sent to work in a war zone. In January of 1942, Rear Admiral Ben Moreell, CEC, USN, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, received authority to create what became known as Naval Construction Battalions (Seabees). These battalions evolved into brigades as the war expanded. More than 325,000 Seabees served during WWII, participating in virtually every theater of operations and working under fire as they constructed defenses, piers, airfields, hospitals, housing and every imaginable facility.\n\nSeabees were not generally impressed with rank. Primarily because Seabees were quite a bit older than many of the officers they encountered.\n\nOne Pacific commander summed up his Seabees this way: They're a rough, tough bunch of men who don't give a damn for anything but getting the job done, the war won and going home.\n\nThe Seabees became the most legendary and celebrated engineering unit of the war, participating in every major island campaign in the Pacific theater. They often operated under fire and frequently were forced to take part in the fighting to defend themselves and their construction projects. In the Pacific Theater they built 111 major airstrips and 441 piers, tanks for the storage of 100m gallons of fuel, housing for 1.5m men and hospitals for 70,"000 patients.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                    ,

Companies from the battalion were eventually deployed to Samoa and New Zealand. The first combat operation for units from the battalion was the Guadalcanal campaign, in which they were equipped with the predecessor of the famed M3 Stuart light tank - the M2A4 light tank. On 7 August 1942, Companies A and B took part in the 1st Marine Division's landings on the Japanese held island.\n\nThe unit went on to participate in the landings on Peleliu, New Gloucester, and Okinawa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

The new 343rd Kokutai consisted of the best pilots, including legendary Japanese ace, Kaneyoshi Muto. The unit was issued the best equipment available.\n\nThe unit was organized as an alternative to the suicidal kamikaze units. Genda believed that even late in the war Japanese pilots were capable of fighting experienced American pilots on equal terms if properly trained and supplied with state-of-the-art aircraft.

EVTDESCMARNE0120;$MONARCHTITLE$, we have reports of former Japanese soldiers who, apparently unaware that the war is over, are still holding out in some remote Pacific locations.  However, we have dispatched a team to convince them to lay down their arms.\n\nHistorically:  Japanese holdouts (or stragglers) were Japanese soldiers in the Pacific Theatre who, after the August 1945 surrender of Japan ending World War II, either adamantly doubted the veracity of the formal surrender due to strong dogmatic or militaristic principles, or simply were not aware of it because communications had been cut off by the United States island hopping campaign.\n\nThey continued to fight the enemy forces, and later local police, for years after the war was over. Some Japanese holdouts volunteered during the First Indochina War and Indonesian War of Independence, to free Asian colonies from Western control despite these having once been colonial ambitions of Imperial Japan during World War II.\n\nIntelligence officer Hiroo Onoda, who was relieved of duty by his former commanding officer on Lubang Island in the Philippines in March 1974, and Teruo Nakamura, who was stationed on Morotai Island in Indonesia and surrendered in December 1974, were the last confirmed holdouts, though rumors persisted of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

EVTDESCMARNE0088;The Raid at Cabanatuan, also known as The Great Raid, was a rescue of Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City, in the Philippines. On January 30,1945, United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas liberated more than 500 from the POW camp.\n\nAfter the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the Battle of Bataan, many were sent to a Cabanatuan prison camp following the Bataan Death March.  In late January 1945, a plan was developed by Sixth Army leaders and Filipino guerrillas to send a small force to rescue the prisoners. A group of over a hundred Rangers and Scouts and several hundred guerrillas traveled 30 miles (48 km) behind Japanese lines to reach the camp.\n\nIn a nighttime raid, under the cover of darkness and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack, and the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. A memorial now sits on the site of the former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the First World War he served on the Western Front as an artillery staff officer. Afterwards he served two long tours with the British Army in India.\n\nShortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Morgan was promoted to Brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division, which he led during the Battle of France. In May 1942 he was became a Lieutenant-General and given command of the I Corps. Morgan's headquarters was designated Force 125, and given the task of dealing with a German thrust through Spain to Gibraltar that never occurred. In March 1943 he was appointed Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate), or COSSAC. As COSSAC he directed the planning for Operation Overlord.

Shall we begin the process, or do you have other plans\n\nHistorically:\n\nOperation Overlord was the code name for the Battle of Normandy, the operation that launched the invasion of German-occupied western Europe during World War II by Allied forces. The operation commenced on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune, commonly known as D-Day). A 12,000-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving almost 7,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June - more than three million allied troops were in France by the end of August.\n\nAllied land forces that saw combat in Normandy on D-Day itself came from the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Free French Forces and Poland also participated in the battle after the assault phase, and there were also minor contingents from Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, and Norway. Other Allied nations participated in the naval and air forces.\n\nThe battle for Normandy continued for more than two months, concluding with the closing of the Falaise pocket on 24 August, the Liberation of Paris on 25 August, and the German retreat across the Seine which was completed on 30 August 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

EVTDESCMARNE0103;To My dear Mum: You certainly won't get this letter until after the event, but I hope it won't be delayed too long. I am writing this on board the ship in which we go across. At the moment, we are at anchor off the coast of England, surrounded by a great many other ships.\n\nWe embarked yesterday afternoon. We had lunch in camp and then got into buses and drove down to the harbour. The men were all very cheerful, cracking jokes and cheering every girl we passed on the way. You would never have dreamed, except from the amount of equipment we were carrying, that we were not going on another exercise. I must say I didn't feel any different myself.\n\nI have known for over a year of course that we would eventually go off on this, or something similar, and I used to dread the last preparations and the final parting from friends and England, but in actual fact (fortunately) I haven't minded at all, now that it is really happening. We all feel very confident and optimistic about the result of the landings, and we all think it is going to be a walkover - at first, anyway. Also, it simply doesn't occur to anyone as a possibility that anything unpleasant can possibly happen - to other people, yes, but not to oneself, so naturally nobody worries about it. And also we are all intensely interested to see how this thing which we have been planning and training for so long does work out in practice. I hope you have been getting some of my letters, but I am afraid they haven't been very good ones recently for obvious reasons - and there probably won't be any more for some time as I shall be rather busy for a few days! All my love to you, and don't worry.\n\nYour loving son, Rodney;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                    ,

EVTDESCMARNE0105;Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force! You are about to embark upon a great crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers in arms on other fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.\n\nYour task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle hardened, he will fight savagely.\n\nBut this is the year 1944! Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man to man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our home fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to victory!\n\nI have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory!\n\nGood Luck! And let us all beseech the blessings of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.\n\n- General Dwight D.

EVTDESCMARNE0107;$MONARCHTITLE$, our boys on the beaches won't stand a chance unless they have some pretty serious naval firepower backing them up.  We have a choice to make. We can either invest additional IC into building up a dedicated naval force for the invasion, or we can make use of our existing naval forces, plus any ships that are planned to be launched between now and the launch of the operation.\n\nHistorically: Operation Neptune, as the naval part of the D-Day invasion was known, was a primarily Royal Navy affair, both in planning and execution. This is widely considered a never surpassed masterpiece of planning. In overall command was Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay RN, who as Flag Officer Dover had controlled the evacuation of over 300,000 soldiers from Dunkirk four years earlier. He had also been responsible for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942 and one of the two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily the following year.\n\nThe invasion fleet was drawn from eight different navies, comprising 6,939 vessels: 1,213 warships,4,126 transport vessels (landing ships and landing craft), and 736 ancillary craft and 864 merchant vessels. Out of the 2,468 major landing vessels in the two task forces deployed on 6 June 1944 346 were American and of the 23 cruisers covering the landings, 17 were British. Of the 16 warships covering the American Western beaches (Utah and Omaha) 50% were British and Allied ships. There were 195,700 naval personnel involved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                     ,

EVTDESCMARNE0200;The coastline of Europe will, in the coming months, be exposed to the danger of an enemy landing in force. The time and place of the landing operations will not be dictated to the enemy by operational considerations alone. Failure in other theatres of war, obligations to allies, and political considerations may persuade him to take decisions which appear unlikely from a purely military point of view.\n\nEven enemy landings with limited objectives can interfere seriously with our own plans if they result in the enemy gaining any kind of foothold on the coast. They can interrupt our coastal sea traffic, and pin down strong forces of our Army and Airforce, which will therefore have to be withdrawn from areas of crucial importance. It would be particularly dangerous should the enemy succeed in capturing our airfields or in establishing his own in areas which he has occupied.\n\nThe many important military and industrial establishments on the coast or in its neighbourhood, some of them equipped with particularly valuable plant, may moreover tempt the enemy to undertake surprise attacks of a local nature\n\nParticular attention must be paid to English preparations for landings on the open coast, for which they have at their disposal many armoured landing craft, built to carry armoured fighting vehicles and heavy weapons. The possibility of parachute and airborne attacks on a large scale must also be envisaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE0214;Operation Loge: Strategic Bombing of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0214;$MONARCHTITLE$, it might be in our best interest to begin a strategic bombing campaign of England.  Doing so should weaken their industrial base, hampering them from building up to any sort of invasion of mainland Europe.\n\nHistorically, The Blitz (from German," "lightning") is the phrase used in English to describe the period of sustained strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941 there were major aerial raids (attacks in which more than 100 tonnes of high explosives were dropped) on 16 British cities. Over a period of 267 days", London was attacked 71 times, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth eight times, Bristol six, Glasgow five, Southampton four, and Portsmouth and Hull three.\n\nStarting on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. More than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London. Ports and industrial centres outside London were also heavily attacked.\n\nThe bombing did not achieve its intended goals of demoralising the British into surrender or significantly damaging their war economy. The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production, and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz did not facilitate Operation Sea Lion, the planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE0604;Proposal: Public Law 77-815;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0604;$MONARCHTITLE$, in order to conserve as much precious copper as we can for making bullet casings, the U.S. Mint has proposed to issue our one cent coins in steel rather than the traditional copper.  This single act could help make millions of bullets that we'll surely need in the days ahead!\n\nHistorically: The 1943 steel cent, also known as a steel war penny or steelie, was a variety of the U.S. one-cent coin which was struck in steel due to wartime shortages of copper. It used the same design that Victor David Brenner had made in 1909 for the copper Lincoln cent.\n\nDue to wartime needs of copper for use in ammunition and other military equipment during World War II, the United States Mint researched various ways to limit dependence and meet conservation goals on copper usage. After trying out several substitutes (ranging from other metals to plastics) to replace the then-standard bronze alloy, the one-cent coin was minted in zinc-coated steel. This alloy caused the new coins to be magnetic and 13% lighter. They were struck at all three mints: Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. As with the bronze cents," coins from the latter two sites have respectively "D" and "S" mintmarks below the date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                         ,

EVTNAMEMARNE0620;Establishment of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0620;$MONARCHTITLE$, we have untapped potential with our many civilian pilots.  Perhaps we should organize them into an auxiliary force\n\nHistorically, Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a Congressionally chartered, federally supported non-profit corporation that serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. CAP is a volunteer organization with an aviation-minded membership that includes people from all backgrounds, lifestyles, and occupations.\n\nCAP was conceived in the late 1930s by aviation advocate Gill Robb Wilson, who foresaw general aviation's potential to supplement America's military operations. With the help of New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, in his capacity as then-Director of the Office of Civilian Defense, CAP was created with Administrative Order 9, signed by LaGuardia on 1 December 1941 and published 8 December 1941. Major General John F. Curry was appointed as the first national commander.\n\nDuring World War II, CAP was seen as a way to use America's civilian aviation resources to aid the war effort instead of grounding them. The organization assumed many missions including anti-submarine patrol and warfare, border patrols, and courier/supply services. During World War II, CAP's coastal patrol had flown 24 million miles, found 173 enemy U-boats, attacked 57, hit 10 and sank two, dropping a total of 83 bombs and depth charges throughout the conflict. By the end of the war, 64 CAP members had lost their lives in the line of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE0621;$MONARCHTITLE$, it might be prudent to tap into our large civilian maritime resources to form an auxiliary to our formal naval forces.\n\nHistorically," The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary (USCG Aux) is the uniformed volunteer component of the United States Coast Guard ("USCG"). Congress established the USCG Aux was June 23",1939, as the United States Coast Guard Reserve. Not quite two years later, on February 19,1941, it was re-designated the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary.\n\nFollowing America's entry into the World War II in December of 1941, recruits flooded into Auxiliary flotillas in a burst of patriotic fever.  June 1942 legislation allowed Auxiliarists to enroll in the Coast Guard Reserve on a part-time temporary basis.  Throughout the war, some 50,000 Auxiliarists constituted the core of the temporary Reserve membership.  These reservists, along with newly enrolled civilians, performed coastal defense and search and rescue duties.  They patrolled bridges, factories, docks, and beaches.  They fought fires, made arrests, guided naval vessels, and conducted anti-submarine warfare. As their ranks grew, thousands of active duty Coast Guard personnel were freed up for service overseas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                    ,

Two years after the Act was passed", the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps, the forerunner to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, was established.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE0624;Formation of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAACs);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0624;The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was the women's auxiliary branch of the United States Army, and was formally created on 15 May 1942 by Public Law 554. The WAAC was modeled after comparable British units, especially the ATS, which caught the attention of Chief of Staff George C. Marshall. In 1942, the first contingent of 800 members of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps began basic training at Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School, Iowa. The women were fitted for uniforms, interviewed," assigned to companies and barracks and inoculated against disease during the first day.\n\nA physical training manual titled "You Must Be Fit" was published by the War Department in July 1943"," aimed at bringing the women recruits to top physical standards. The manual began by naming the responsibility of the women: "Your Job: To Replace Men. Be Ready To Take Over." It cited the commitment of women to the war effort in England", Russia, Germany and Japan, and emphasized that the WAAC recruits must be physically able to take on any job assigned to them. The fitness manual was state-of-the-art for its day, with sections on warming up, and progressive body-weight strength-building exercises for the arms, legs, stomach, and neck and back. It included a section on designing a personal fitness routine after basic training," and concluded with "The Army Way to Health and Added Attractiveness" with advice on skin care", make-up, and hair styles.\n\nAbout 150,000 American women eventually served in the WAAC (and later, the WAC) during World War II. They were the first women other than nurses to serve with the Army. Those 150,000 women who did serve released the equivalent of 7 divisions of men for combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMARNE0624;Yes, let's activate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                             ,
EVTNAMEMARNE0625;WAAC Converts to Women's Army Corps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0625;Originally formed as the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in 1942, the organization was converted to full military status on July 1st, 1943.  Its first director was Oveta Culp Hobby, a prominent society woman in Texas.\n\nAbout 150,000 American women eventually served in the WAAC and WAC during World War II. They were the first women other than nurses to serve with the Army. While conservative opinion in the leadership of the Army and public opinion generally was initially opposed to women serving in uniform, the shortage of men necessitated a new policy. While most women served stateside, some went to various places around the world, including Europe, North Africa, and New Guinea. For example," WACs landed on Normandy Beach just a few weeks after the initial invasion.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur called the WACs "my best soldiers", adding that they worked harder, complained less," and were better disciplined than men. Many generals wanted more of them and proposed to draft women but it was realized that this "would provoke considerable public outcry and Congressional opposition", and so the War Department declined to take such a drastic step. Those 150,"000 women who did serve released the equivalent of 7 divisions of men for combat. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said that "their contributions in efficiency", skill, spirit," and determination are immeasurable".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTNAMEMARNE0650;Blockade Action Underway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE0650;$MONARCHTITLE$, we've successfully blockaded our enemies!\n\nHistorically: A blockade is an effort to cut off food, supplies, war material or communications from a particular area by force, either in part or totally. A blockade should not be confused with an embargo or sanctions, which are legal barriers to trade, and is distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city. Most blockades historically took place at sea, with the blockading power seeking to cut off all maritime transport from and to the blockaded country - although stopping all land transport to and from an area may also be considered a blockade. In the 20th century air power has also been used to enhance the effectiveness of the blockade by halting all air traffic within the blockaded air space.\n\nPlayer note:  In an effort not to create popup event spam, this is a one-time notification event.  You will not receive additional blockade event notifications if you blockade a major port (level 8 or above), however the blockade effect will still be enacted on the hostile owner of the port in question.\n\nGood luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE0709;$MONARCHTITLE$, I am pleased to report that our forces have captured and arrested Iva Toguri, the infamous Tokyo Rose.  Our troops will no longer have to endure her endless propaganda broadcasts.  This should definitely be a solid boost to morale!\n\nHistorically: When the war ended," the U.S. military detained Toguri for a year before releasing her for lack of evidence. Department of Justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were "innocuous". But when Toguri tried to return to the US", a popular uproar ensued because Walter Winchell, the powerful broadcast personality, and the American Legion lobbied relentlessly for a trial, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to renew its investigation of Toguri's wartime activities. Her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one of eight counts of treason. In 1974, investigative journalists found that key witnesses claimed they were forced to lie during testimony. Toguri was pardoned by U.S. President Gerald Ford in 1977.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE0710;Rita Luisa Zucca (born 1912) was an Italian-American radio announcer who broadcast Axis propaganda to Allied troops in Italy and North Africa. She became known as one of the "Axis Sallys", along with Mildred Gillars, who broadcast out of Berlin, Germany.\n\nZucca's father, Louis, owned a very successful restaurant in New York's Midtown district in the 1930s and 1940s, called Zucca's Italian Garden. Located at 116-118-120 West 49th Street, the restaurant had its own promotional postcards which displayed a distinctly refined setting. Zucca spent her teenage years in a convent school in Florence and, as a young woman, had worked in the family business.\n\nShe returned to Italy in 1938, working as a typist and renouncing her American citizenship three years later to save her family's property from expropriation by Mussolini's government. As the Allied invasion of Italy progressed, the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini decided to try and emulate the German radios Axis Sally broadcasts of Mildred Gillars. In the summer of 1943, the Italian national radio network in Rome hired the 30-year-old Zucca with this aim in mind.According to one account," Zucca signed onto each show by uttering "Hello Suckers!" and her signature tune was "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea".\n\nStarting her broadcasts with the catchphrase of "Hello"," suckers!", she sometimes used intelligence provided by the German embassy in Rome in an attempt to confuse Allied troops. One notable example came on July 8,1943," the night before the invasion of Sicily. Zucca told "the wonderful boys of the 504th Parachute Regiment" that "We know where and when you are jumping and you will be wiped out.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                     ,

"Soft-Voiced 'Sally from Berlin' Found to Be Ugly ExN.Y. Girl" was a typical headline"," with descriptions of the young mother as "[as] ugly and unattractive in person as her voice was appealing."

EVTDESCMARNE0720;William Joyce, aka Lord Haw-Haw, was an Irish-American fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster to the United Kingdom during the Second World War.\n\nHis announcement 'Germany calling, Germany calling' was a familiar sound across the airwaves, introducing threats and misinformation that he broadcast from his Hamburg base.\n\nIn late August 1939, shortly before war was declared, Joyce and his wife Margaret fled to Germany. Joyce had been tipped off that the British authorities intended to detain him under Defence Regulation 18B. Joyce became a naturalised German citizen in 1940.In Berlin," Joyce could not find employment until a chance meeting with fellow Mosleyite Dorothy Eckersley got him an audition at the Rundfunkhaus ("broadcasting house"). Eckersley was the former wife or second wife of the Chief Engineer of the British Broadcasting Corporation", Peter Eckersley. Despite having a heavy cold and almost losing his voice, he was recruited immediately for radio announcements and script writing at German radio's English service. William Joyce replaced Wolf Mittler.Although listening to his broadcasts was officially discouraged (but not illegal), many Britons did tune in. At the height of his influence, in 1940 Joyce had an estimated six million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,

Our troops will no longer have to endure his endless propaganda broadcasts.  This should definitely be a solid boost to morale!\n\nHistorically: At the end of the war", Joyce was captured by British forces at Flensburg, near the German border with Denmark. Spotting a dishevelled figure while resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers  including a Jewish German, Geoffrey Perry (born Horst Pinschewer), who had left Germany before the war  engaged him in conversation in French and English. After they asked if he was Joyce, he reached for his pocket (actually reaching for a false passport).  Believing he was armed, they shot him through the buttocks, leaving four wounds.\n\nTwo intelligence officers then drove him to a border post, and handed him to British military police. Joyce was then taken to London and tried at the Old Bailey on three counts of high treason. Joyce was executed on 3 January 1946 at Wandsworth Prison, aged 39.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE0400;$MONARCHTITLE$, we are at war, our treasury is lacking, and our war machine needs feeding!  We have two basic options.\n\nWe can issue War Bonds, which are debt securities that we can issue to our people. Our people are sure to rally around the flag if we issue these! Alternatively, we can choose to levy new taxes from our citizens.  They won't like it, but it is hard to argue against the power of enormous amounts of cold, hard cash.\n\nPlayer notes: In short, War Bonds raise lower amounts of capital, and provide a small boost to national unity.  Raising taxes generates larger sums of capital, but comes at a steep cost in terms of dissent.  Additionally, the revenue associated with these financial instruments are collected from each province you own. In doing so, they scale according to the overall size of your country. Revenue will be collected via silent event in the background each month - you will not receive a notification, and the benefits do not show up as a modifier in the tooltips above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,

EVTNAMEMARNE9080;Installation Security: Barbed Wire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE9080;$MONARCHTITLE$, we have beefed up our perimeter defenses of our vital facilities with layers of barbed wire. This should definitely help impede any would-be troublemakers.\n\nHistorically: Barbed wire is a type of steel fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strand(s). It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls surrounding secured property. It is also a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare (as a wire obstacle).\n\nA person trying to pass through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury. Barbed wire fencing requires only fence posts, wire, and fixing devices such as staples. It is simple to construct and quick to erect, even by an unskilled person.\n\nBarbed wire was used extensively by all participating combatants in World War I to prevent movement, with deadly consequences. Barbed wire entanglements were placed in front of trenches to prevent direct charges on men below, increasingly leading to greater use of more advanced weapons such as high powered machine guns and grenades. A feature of these entanglements was that the barbs were much closer together, often forming a continuous sequence.\n\nBarbed wire could be exposed to heavy bombardments because it could be easily replaced, and its structure included so much open space that machine guns rarely destroyed enough of it to defeat its purpose. However barbed wire was defeated by the tank, as shown by the Allied breakthrough at Amiens through German lines in August 1918.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,

EVTDESCMARNE9081;$MONARCHTITLE$, we have beefed up our perimeter defenses of our vital facilities with strategically placed guard towers. We should see any troublemakers coming a mile away!\n\nHistorically:\n\nA guard tower (or watchtower) is a type of fortification used in many parts of the world. It differs from a regular tower in that its primary use is military," and from a "turret" in that it is usually a freestanding structure. Its main purpose is to provide a high", safe place from which a sentinel or guard may observe the surrounding area. In some cases, non-military towers, such as religious pagodas, may also be used as guard towers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE9082;$MONARCHTITLE$, we have beefed up our perimeter defenses of our vital facilities with strategically placed searchlights. They shall take the cover of darkness away from those who would do us harm!\n\nHistorically: A searchlight (or spotlight) is an apparatus that combines an extremely luminous source (traditionally a carbon arc lamp) with a mirrored parabolic reflector to project a powerful beam of light of approximately parallel rays in a particular direction, usually constructed so that it can be swiveled about.\n\nSearchlights were used extensively in defense against nighttime bomber raids during the Second World War. Controlled by sound locators and radars, searchlights could track bombers, indicating targets to anti-aircraft guns and night fighters and dazzling crews.\n\nSearchlights were occasionally used tactically in ground battles. One famous occasion was the Soviets' use of seachlights during the Battle of Berlin in April 1945. 143 searchlights were directed at the German defense force across the Neisse River, with the aim of temporarily blinding them during a Soviet offensive. However, the morning fog diffused the light and silhouetted the attacking Soviet forces, making them clearly visible to the Germans. The Soviets suffered heavy losses as a result and were forced to delay their invasion of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,

EVTDESCMARNE9100;The 1st Ranger Battalion is now available at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nHistorically:\n\nAs the Second World War progressed, Darby saw rapid promotion to the grade of lieutenant colonel. He was one of the first U.S. troops sent to Northern Ireland at the outbreak of the war, and during his stay there, he became interested in the British Commandos. His interest was such that, when the U.S. Army decided to establish its Ranger units, he was assigned to direct their organization and training. Many of the original Rangers were volunteers from the Red Bull," the 34th Infantry Division.\n\n"Darby's Rangers" trained with their British counterparts in Scotland and in 1943"," the 1st Ranger Battalion made its first assault at Arzew. Darby was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for his actions during that operation. The citation stated:\n\n"Lt. Col. Darby struck with his force with complete surprise at dawn in the rear of a strongly fortified enemy position. Always conspicuously at the head of his troops", he personally led assaults against the enemy line in the face of heavy machine gun and artillery fire, establishing the fury of the Ranger attack by his skillful employment of hand grenades in close quarter fighting. On March 22, Lt. Col. Darby directed his battalion in advance on Bon Hamean," capturing prisoners and destroying a battery of self propelled artillery."\n\nThe 1st Ranger Battalion saw further action in the Italian Campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTDESCMARNE9101;$MONARCHTITLE$, the 29th Ranger Battalion is now available at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nHistorically:\n\nThe 29th Provisional Ranger Battalion was a United States Army unit in World War II. Formed in December 1942 in England as a detachment of volunteers from the 29th Infantry Division, the battalion underwent commando training under British supervision and participated in raids on German installations, mostly in concert with No. 4 Commando.\n\nIn 1943, an entire company of the 29th was scheduled to raid the French coast. However, on 18 October 1943, a notice was posted stating that the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion would cease to exist. All of the battalion's Rangers were enraged. Some of them turned their fury on their huts, shooting them up. The soldiers of the 29th were returned to their original units and fought bravely for the rest of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE9102;$MONARCHTITLE$, the 2nd Ranger Battalion (Rudder's Raiders) is now available at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nHistorically:\n\nOn 1 April 1943 the 2nd Ranger Battalion was formed at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. They were officially activated in September 1943 and shipped to Great Britain where they were prepared for Operation Overlord as part of six Ranger battalions of WW2.\n\nOn 6 June 1944, Dog, Easy, and Fox Companies, commanded by Lt. Colonel James Rudder, landed at Pointe du Hoc in Normandy. The 225 Rangers had set off from Britain to launch an assault upon the cliffs overlooking the English Channel.\n\nUnfortunately, several landing craft containing Rangers and supplies capsized in the stormy waters and many Rangers drowned due to heavy equipment, but others were saved and hoisted into other DUKWs to participate in the attack. The Rangers had planned to land at the base of the cliffs at 0600 hours, however, because of a navigational error, they landed nearly an hour late. This cost the lives of more Rangers as well as the element of surprise. During the attack, the 190 remaining Rangers scaled the cliffs utilizing rope ladders, but only 90 Rangers were still able to bear arms after two days of relentless fighting. During the assault, 2nd Battalion managed to disable a battery of 155mm French artillery captured by the Germans, which was their primary objective. These guns were to be aimed at Utah Beach, however, the Rangers prevented their use, saving countless American lives on the shores of Normandy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE9103;Kachin Rangers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE9103;$MONARCHTITLE$, Detachment 101 of the OSS is now available at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nHistorically:\n\nOn April 14,1942, William Donovan, as Coordinator of Information (forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services), activated Detachment 101 for action behind enemy lines in Burma. The first unit of its kind, the Detachment was charged with gathering intelligence, harassing the Japanese through guerrilla actions, identifying targets for the Army Air Force to bomb, and rescuing downed Allied airmen. Because Detachment 101 was never larger than a few hundred Americans, it relied on support from various tribal groups in Burma. In particular, the vigorously anti-Japanese Kachin people were vital to the units success. By the time of its deactivation on July 12,1945, Detachment 101 had scored impressive results. According to official statistics, with a loss of some 22 Americans, Detachment 101 killed 5,428 Japanese and rescued 574 Allied personnel.\n\n101's efforts opened the way for Stilwell's Chinese forces, Wingate's Raiders, Merrill's Marauders," and the great counter-attack against the Japanese Imperial life-line."\n\nDuring most of the unit's existence", it funded and coordinated various resistance groups made up of the Kachin peoples of northern Burma. One resistance force was known as the Kachin Rangers and was under the command of Carl F. Eifler though often the term Kachin Rangers has been used to describe all Kachin Forces raised during the war by the Americans in Northern Burma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                   ,

EVTDESCMARNE9104;$MONARCHTITLE$,the First Special Service Force is now available at Fort William Henry Harrison (near Helena, Montana).\n\nHistorically:\n\nThe Devil's Brigade (also called The Black Devils and The Black Devils' Brigade and Freddie's Freighters, officially the 1st Special Service Force), was an elite, joint World War II American-Canadian commando unit organized in 1942 and trained at Fort William Henry Harrison in the United States. The brigade fought in the Aleutian Islands, Italy, and southern France before being disbanded in December 1944. The modern American and Canadian special operations forces trace their heritage to this unit.\n\nWhile carrying out beachhead operations at Anzio," legend has it that a member of the Force uncovered the journal of a German lieutenant from the Herman Goering Division. The journal contained the following entry:\n\n"The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come."\n\nThis legend was never verified as fact by any member of the brigade", however, the force was known as the Black Devils and as the Devil's Brigade. The members of the brigade preferred the latter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE9105;$MONARCHTITLE$, the 4th Ranger Battalion is now available at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nHistorically:\n\nAfter the success of 1st Ranger Battalion in the North Africa campaign, the Army saw the merit in small special operations units. Portions of 1st Ranger Battalion was split into 2nd, 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions.\n\nMuch like their predecessor, 4th Ranger Battalion had a strict training regimen, directed by William Orlando Darby. 3rd and 4th Battalions trained alongside each other, with members of 1st Battalion acting as training cadre. Passing along the lessons taught by the British 3 Commando Brigade, the Rangers engaged in rough training, including live-fire exercises (an uncommon practice at the time). Major Roy Murray took command of the Rangers as they prepared for their first mission.\n\nOn 10 July 1943, 4th Battalion, along with 1st and 3rd spearheaded Seventh Army's Amphibious Battle of Gela and Licata, beginning the Allied invasion of Sicily. Arriving ahead of the 1st Infantry Division," the Rangers quickly encountered the Italian 4th "Livorno" Division and the Hermann Goering Division.\n\nFacing an overwhelming surprise attack", the Livorno Division surrendered. The Hermann Goering Division was pushed back into the city of Messina where it held off the Allied forces for the remaining German forces to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE9106;Pathfinders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE9106;$MONARCHTITLE$, Pathfinder commandos are now available at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nHistorically:\n\nA pathfinder is a paratrooper, soldier or covert operative who is inserted or dropped into place in order to set up and operate drop zones for airborne operations, air resupply operations, or other air operations in support of the ground unit commander.\n\nDuring World War II, the pathfinders were a group of volunteers selected within the Airborne units who were specially trained to operate navigation aids to guide the main airborne body to the drop zones. The pathfinder teams (sticks) were made up of a group of eight to twelve pathfinders and a group of six bodyguards whose job was to defend the pathfinders while they set up their equipment. The pathfinder teams dropped approximately thirty minutes before the main body in order to locate designated drop zones and provide radio and visual guides for the main force in order to improve the accuracy of the jump. These navigational aids included compass beacons, colored panels, Eureka radar sets, and colored smoke. When they jumped, the pathfinders many times would encounter less resistance than the follow-up waves of paratroopers, simply because they had the element of surprise on their side.\n\nOnce the main body jumped, the pathfinders then joined their original units and fought as standard airborne infantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the Battle of Normandy, they landed on Omaha Beach along with companies A, B and C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, where elements of the 116th Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division were pinned down by murderous machinegun fire and mortars from the heights above. It was there that the situation was so critical that General Omar Bradley was seriously considering abandoning the beachhead, instead of sending more men to die. And it was then and there that Gen. Norman Cota, Assistant Division Commander of the 29th Infantry Division," gave the now famous order that has become the motto of the 75th Ranger Regiment: "Rangers"," Lead The Way!"\n\nThe 5th Battalion Rangers broke across the sea wall and barbed wire entanglements", and up the pillbox-rimmed heights under intense enemy machine-gun and mortar fire and with A and B Companies of the 2nd Battalion and some elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment, advanced four miles (6 km) to the key town of Vierville-sur-Mer, thus opening the breach for supporting troops to follow-up and expand the beachhead. Meanwhile C Company of the 2nd Battalion, due to rough seas, landed west of the Vierville draw and suffered 50% casualties during the landing, but still scaled a 90-foot cliff using ropes and bayonets to knock out a formidable enemy position that was sweeping the beach with deadly fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The battalion is best known for its role in the Raid at Cabanatuan in January 1945.\n\nThe 6th Rangers were to lead the invasion of the Philippines. The battalion left for Leyte in the Philippines on 10 October 1944. It was to secure the islands of Dinagat, Homonhon and Suluan, located in the entrance to the Leyte Gulf. These islands had the potential to disrupt 6th Army's landing operations if they remained in Japanese hands. After initial delays due to bad weather, the operation went ahead on 18 October, and was a success. The 6th Rangers on Dinagat raised the first American flag on Philippine soil as part of General Douglas MacArthur's 'Return to the Philippines'.\n\nCabanatuan Raid: Sixth Army Intelligence indicated that the Japanese were holding a large number of American POWs in Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila. An incident at a camp on Palawan led intelligence to believe that the POWs would be executed as the Imperial Japanese Army retreated. General Walter Krueger, 6th Army commander, ordered 6th Rangers to bring the prisoners out alive - which they did in a daring raid. During the following battle, the Rangers rescued 511 POWs, and killed 523 enemy troops for the loss of two rangers Killed & 1 POW died and 21 Filipino Guerillas wounded. The operation is still classed as the most successful rescue operation in the history of the US military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,

It was raised in 1940 from the ranks of the existing independent companies. Operationally they carried out a series of small scale cross channel raids and spearheaded the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. They were then sent to the India as part of the 3rd Commando Brigade and took part in operations in the Burma Campaign. During the Second World War only eight commandos were recipients of the Victoria Cross two of the eight were from No. 1 Commando. After the war they were sent to reoccupy Hong Kong before being amalgamated with No. 5 Commando and became known as No. 1/5 Commando. The amalgamated No. 1/5 Commando was disbanded in 1946.\n\nNo. 2 Commando was a battalion-sized British Commando unit of the British Army during the Second World War. The No. 2 Commando unit was reformed three times during the Second World War. The original No. 2 Commando, unlike the other commando units, was formed from volunteers from across the United Kingdom and was always intended to be a parachute unit. On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties, and, on 21 November, was re-designated as the 11th Special Air Service (SAS) Battalion and eventually re-designated 1st Parachute Battalion. After their re-designation as the 11th SAS Battalion, a second No. 2 Commando was formed.

Formed in July 1940 from volunteers for special service," it was the first such unit to carry the title of "Commando". Shortly afterwards the unit was involved in a largely unsuccessful raid upon the German-occupied Channel Island of Guernsey. In 1941 they were involved in successful raids on the Lofoten Islands and Vaagso", in Norway, before taking part in the costly Dieppe raid in August 1942.\n\nNo. 4 Commando was a battalion-sized British Army commando unit, formed in 1940 early in the Second World War. Although it was raised to conduct small-scale raids and harass garrisons along the coast of German-occupied France, it was mainly employed as a highly trained infantry assault unit. The unit's first operation was the successful raid on the Lofoten Islands in March 1941. The next two planned operations were both cancelled and it was not until 1942 that No. 4 Commando took part in another raid, Operation Abercrombie, a raid on the French coastal town of Hardelot. Later the same year No. 4 was one of three commando units selected for the Dieppe raid. Under the command of Lord Lovat, No. 4 Commando landed on the right flank of the main landings and successfully silenced a German gun battery. This was the only complete success of the operation, which was eventually aborted following heavy losses. It also participated in the Normandy landings, landing on Sword beach 30 minutes ahead of the main invasion force;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,

It was originally created to conduct raids and sabotage far behind enemy lines in the desert, and operated in conjunction with the existing Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). Stirling (formerly of No.8 Commando) looked for recruits with rugged individualism and initiative and recruited specialists from Layforce and other units.\n\nTheir first mission, parachuting behind enemy lines in support of General Sir Claude Auchinleck's attack in November 1941, was a disaster. Only 22 out of 62 troopers reached the rendezvous point. Stirling still managed to organise another assault against the German airfields at Aqedabia, Sirte and Agheila, this time transported by the LRDG. They destroyed 61 enemy aircraft without a single casualty. 1st SAS earned regimental status and Lieutenant Stirling's brother Bill began to organise a second regiment, 2.

In 1944 training was also carried out in Brindisi", Italy, which had by then fallen to the Allies.\n\nInitially the name was informal and was used mainly by the soldiers who volunteered to parachute into Poland. However, from September 1941 it became official and was used in all documents. It was applied both to the secret Polish Headquarters training unit created to provide agents with necessary knowledge, money and equipment, as well as to agents who were transported to Poland and to other German-occupied countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The battalion was raised at Cowshot Camp in Brookwood (now part of the Pirbright Camp complex), being incorporated into 101 RM Bde, along with the 1st RM Battalion. Between August and October 1940 the battalion took part in operations in Dakar. On return until August 1943 the battalion conducted extensive training in Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Wight and Burley, where the battalion reformed as 45 RM Commando on 1 August 1943.\n\nAfter reforming and retitling, the unit transitioned to the Commando role as a formed unit, by-passing the individual volunteer and selection process undertaken by Army Commando candidates. Personnel undertook, and completed, the Commando Basic Training Course at Achnacarry, Scotland.\n\nAs part of the 1st Special Service Brigade the Commando participated in Operation Overlord, the D-Day Normandy landings, going on to move through Europe into Germany, including Montforterbeek on 23 January 1945.

Bagnold, acting under the direction of General Archibald Wavell. Bagnold was assisted by Captain Patrick Clayton and Captain William Shaw. At first the majority of the men were from New Zealand, but they were soon joined by Rhodesian and British volunteers, whereupon new sub-units were formed and the name was changed to the better-known Long Range Desert Group (LRDG).

Its official name was No. 1 Demolition Squadron, PPA and it was formed specifically to attack Rommels fuel supplies, in support of the offensive at El Alamein. They were deployed in many roles, often clandestine, and for several months even operated as regular front line troops, holding a sector of the Allied front line that was badly depleted after the withdrawal of forces for the D-Day landings in Normandy, nipping around in their jeeps to fool the Germans into believing that they were opposed by much larger units.\n\nPopskis nickname referred to a Daily Mirror cartoon character, and was given to him by Captain Bill Kennedy Shaw, the LRDGs Intelligence Officer," because his signallers had problems with "Peniakoff". The units cover name came from Hacketts exasperation at Popskis delay in coming up with something suitable: "You had better find a name quick or we shall call you Popskis Private Army". "Ill take it" said Popski.\n\nAt various times PPA worked alongside other secret units such as the LRDG", SAS, No. 1 Special Force (SOE), Phantom, A Force and OSS. Along the way they adopted many strays, including Russian, Italian and German POWs. Popskis Private Army finished the war with a flourish: sailing some of their jeeps on RCLs to St. Mark's Square in Venice where they drove round and round just for the hell of it, the only wheeled vehicles ever to have been there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                     ,

Formed in February 1941 under the command of Colonel Robert Laycock, after whom the force was named, it consisted of approximately 2,000 men and served in the Middle Eastern theatre of operations. Initially tasked with conducting raiding operations to disrupt Axis lines of communication in the Mediterranean it was planned that they would take part in operations to capture the Greek island of Rhodes. As the strategic situation in the theatre turned against the Allies, however, the commandos were largely diverted from their original role and were used primarily to reinforce regular troops throughout the Mediterranean theatre.\n\nElements of the force saw action in Bardia, Crete, Syria, and Tobruk before they were disbanded in August 1941.

It was created by General Charles de Gaulle in 1943 and modeled after the British Chindits Special Forces who fought in the Burma Campaign.\n\nThe CLI was created on November 4", 1943 in Jijel, Kabylie (French Algeria) with 500 volunteer commandos under Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Huard. Its purpose was to reinforce the resistance in Japanese occupied French Indochina. Local resistance was led by General Mordant (a.k.a. Narcisse) who came from mainland France in 1941.\n\nWhile the commandos trained in Jijel, Commandant de Crevècoeur arrived at Meerut, North West India on November 10, 1943 to introduce the CLI to British Special Operations Executive (SOE) Force 136's Colin Hercules Mackenzie. The first CLI trainees were sent to Poona (100 km from Bombay) for jungle warfare instruction under the British.\n\nOn March 15, 1944 the French Indochina guerrillas numbered 1,349 (993 locals and 356 Europeans) including 242 in Laos (195 locals and 47 Europeans).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Choc's original mission was to parachute behind enemy lines and operate in small groups to disrupt enemy lines of communication and supply. Organizationally, a Choc squad (Groupe de combat) numbered 14 men -- one leader, one LMG gunner, two ammo bearers, a sniper, and nine men armed with sub machine guns. The heaviest weapons authorized for the Bataillon de Choc were the LMG's. Three Choc squads and a small HQ made up their platoons.\n\nConfusingly," the companies in the Groupe de commandos d'Afrique (a battalion sized unit) were called "Commando de Choc", but were organized quite differently from the companies in the Bataillon de Choc.

Such was the uncertainty of what they would find that they trained for all conceivable contingencies from protection against chemical warfare and clearing obstacles to driving Sherman tanks! However", their main task was to keep the traffic of men, machines and supplies flowing through the beach area.\n\nW Commando was made up of volunteer members of the Royal Canadian Navy. In August of 1943 it was assigned overseas to HMS Armadillo at Ardentinney in the Clyde estuary of Scotland. The Commando unit was made up of 3 sub-units, W 1, W 2 and W 3 each with 25 ratings and leading seamen and 3 officers under the combined leadership of a Commanding Beach Master and an Assistant Beach Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

The modern American and Canadian special operations forces trace their heritage to this unit.\n\nWhile carrying out beachhead operations at Anzio," legend has it that a member of the Force uncovered the journal of a German lieutenant from the Herman Goering Division. The journal contained the following entry:\n\n"The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come."\n\nThis legend was never verified as fact by any member of the brigade", however, the force was known as the Black Devils and as the Devil's Brigade.

EVTDESCMARNE9150;$MONARCHTITLE$, The Bataillon Ebbinghaus is available in Berlin.  Historically:\n\n During WWI, the legacy of German General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's superb guerrilla war in East Africa and T.E. Lawrence's use of Arab hit-and-run tactics to fight the Turks in the Middle East made a profound mark upon one of Lettow-Vorbeck's junior officers, a young captain named Theodore von Hippel.\n\nFinding a place in the German intelligence community after the war, Hippel proposed utilizing small, elite units to penetrate enemy defenses before hostilities or offensive actions had begun. However, the idea ran afoul of the stiff-necked Prussian sense of honor. Such units, the majority believed, would be an infringement of the rules of war, and furthermore, such saboteurs were not worthy of being called soldiers. Hippel persevered, however, and when he became an officer in the Abwehr, his ideas finally found a home.\n\nThe German high command allowed Hippel to form a battalion to do what he had proposed--sabotage the enemy's ability to respond to German attacks by capturing roadways and bridges ahead of the main force and securing strategic targets before they were demolished. Known as the Ebbinghaus battalion, the unit performed magnificently during the Polish campaign, though it was dissolved shortly afterward. It had not failed, however, to gain notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                     ,

Rather than recruiting only those who embodied the Aryan ideal of the übermensch, Hippel scoured the Reich to find Slavs, Poles and other ethnics willing to fight for Germany. Every recruit had to be fluent in at least one foreign language. However, many recruits were fluent in several. The recruits were also schooled in the customs and traditions of their specific region. Knowing every habit and mannerism in their area of operations would enable the men to blend in and operate as effective saboteurs.\n\nThe formation was barracked at Stendal in the old Mark of Brandenburg, Berlin, and had training grounds nearby in Friedenthal (Oranienburg).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At the end of 1942, Bergmann conducted a successful sortie through the Soviet lines, bringing with them some 300 Red Army defectors, and covered the German retreat from the Caucasus. Bergmann went through a series of hard-fought engagements with the Soviet partisans and regular forces in the Crimea in February 1943 and was dissolved  like other Ostlegionen units  at the end of 1943.

The Japanese military recruited many young men from friendly tribes into service shortly before the start of World War II.

Training was under the direction of officers from the Nakano School," which specialized in insurgency and guerilla warfare. Units consisting entirely of "Takasago Volunteers" served with distinction in the Philippines", Netherlands East Indies, Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where they fought against Americans and Australians forces.\n\nTowards the end of the war, 60 members of the Takasago Volunteers were organized into the Kaoru Special Attack Corps for a suicide mission similar to that of the Giretsu Kuteitai, and attacked a USAAF landing strip on Leyte.\n\nThe tribesmen were well known for their jungle survival ability.

EVTDESCMARNE9181;$MONARCHTITLE$, the Takasago Giyutai are now available in Tokyo.\n\nHistorically: Takasago Volunteers (Takasago Giyutai) were volunteers in the Imperial Japanese Army, recruited from the Taiwanese aboriginal tribes during WWII.\n\nThe IJA was interested in the using Taiwanese aborigines in special forces operations, as they were viewed as being more physically capable of operating in the tropical and sub-tropical regions in Southeast Asia than ethnic Japanese, and, coming from a hunter-gatherer culture, would be able to operate with minimal logistics support. The Japanese military recruited many young men from friendly tribes into service shortly before the start of World War II. The total number was confidential and estimates on the numbers recruited range from 1800 to 5000 men. Training was under the direction of officers from the Nakano School," which specialized in insurgency and guerilla warfare. Units consisting entirely of "Takasago Volunteers" served with distinction in the Philippines", Netherlands East Indies, Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where they fought against Americans and Australians forces.\n\nTowards the end of the war, 60 members of the Takasago Volunteers were organized into the Kaoru Special Attack Corps for a suicide mission similar to that of the Giretsu Kuteitai, and attacked a USAAF landing strip on Leyte.\n\nThe tribesmen were well known for their jungle survival ability. The Takasago 1st & 2nd Raiding Companies wore standard Japanese service uniforms, their only identifiable item being the traditional Formosan Giyuto sword.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,

The Takasago were famous as courageous and skilled jungle fighters," who traditionally carried a short giyuto ("loyalty sword".) Officers and technical soldiers such as medics and signallers were Japanese.\n\nInspired by the success of provisional raider units formed in eastern New Guinea", the Yugekitai was trained by the staff of the Nakano intelligence school in guerrilla and infiltration tactics, demolitions, camouflage, and the use of special weapons and equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Two days later it passed the German border and soon breached the Siegfried Line, taking part in the Battle of Hurtgen Forest.\n\nThe 3rd Armored Division continued fighting during the Battle of Bulge, far north of the deepest German penetration. Countering German attacks, it severed an important highway leading to St Vith. By late January 1945, the German offensive had been checked, and the division began pushing its way into Germany.

Since its initial members came from all 48 states, the unit acquired the nickname All-American, which is the basis for its famed AA shoulder patch.\n\nOn 15 August 1942, the 82nd Infantry Division became the Army's first airborne division, and was redesignated the 82nd Airborne Division. In April 1943, its paratroopers deployed to North Africa under the command of Major General Matthew B. Ridgway to take part in the campaign to invade Italy. The division's first two combat operations were parachute assaults into Sicily on 9 July and Salerno on 13 September. The initial assault on Sicily, by the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was the first regimental-sized combat parachute assault conducted by the United States Army. The first glider assault did not occur until Operation Neptune as part of D-Day. Glider troopers of the 319th and 320th Glider Field Artillery and the 325th Glider Infantry instead arrived in Italy by landing craft at Maiori (319th) and Salerno (320th, 325th).\n\nThe 82nd Airborne Division went on to distinguish itself via operations in Normandy, Operation Market Garden, and the Battle of the Bulge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

The Division was the last unit of its size to enter into combat operations during the war.  This was due to the specialized training in mountain and winter warfare that units within the Division had been going through since 1941.  The Army did not find it prudent to deploy the Division to one theater only to have a more urgent use for it arise in another theater of the war.  Finally, in 1945 the Division entered into combat in the Apennine Mountains of Italy.  This area was perfectly suited for the 10th Mountain Division to use its specialized skills.  The Division would suffer one of the highest rates of casualites in the war, all while conducting one of the fastest advances through enemy territory of any other division in the war.

In the immediate emergency following Pearl Harbor, the United States had hurriedly sent three individual regiments to defend New Caledonia against a feared Japanese attack. This division was the only division formed outside of United States territory during World War II (a distinction it would repeat when reformed during the Vietnam War). At the suggestion of a subordinate, the division's commander, Major General Alexander Patch," requested that the new unit be known as the Americal Division-the name being a contraction of "American"," New Caledonian Division". This was unusual", as most U.S. divisions are known by a number. After World War II the Americal Division was officially re-designated as the 23rd Infantry Division. However, it was rarely referred to as such, even on official orders.\n\nThe Americal division distinguished itself during combat operations on Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and in the Phillipines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,

On October 1,1941, the Hawaiian Division was split to create the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions. The 25th Infantry Division was stationed at Schofield Barracks, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The Division was just over two months old when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor thrusting the United States into World War Two. After the attack, the Division moved into beach defensive positions, preparing to defend Honolulu from invasion.\n\nThe division continued in its role as protector of Oahu until November 1942, when they were ordered into action against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands. On November 25th the Division moved to Guadalcanal. The 25th Infantry Division took part in some of the bitterest fighting in the Pacific Theater. By February 5,1943, organized enemy resistance had ended on Guadalcanal. A period of garrison duty followed until July. Due to their superior performance during the operation," the 25th Infantry Division earned its nickname: "Tropic Lightning.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

Indeed, the Second's deeds at Tarawa rank with the Spartans at Thermopylae, and the thin red line of British infantry at Waterloo. But Tarawa was only one of the campaigns that the Silent Second fought in the Pacific.

The division was initially built around the 9th Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Lemuel C. Shepherd," Jr. who later became the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Major General Charles D. Barrett was the first commanding general of the division.\n\nThe Third Marine Division was a workhorse of the Pacific war.

The division had a solid core of combat veterans from the beginning, however there were many issues raising the total required number of Marines as the Marine Corps had to provide combat replacements to other divisions and staff the newly formed 6th Marine Division also. Among the personnel forming the new division were Marines from the former 1st Marine Parachute Regiment, the Raider Training Battalion, the Parachute Training School, West Coast, and the Parachute Replacement Company.\n\nParts of the division began to deploy overseas to act as the reserve force during the Battle of Guam where they were not needed. Because of this they were sent to Camp Tarawa near Hilo, Hawaii for further training. After more extensive training the division loaded ships and left Hawaii in January 1945. By mid-February they were sailing past Saipan headed for Iwo Jima.\n\nThe division landed on the left northeast of Mount Suribachi and sustained heavy initial losses so much so that by that afternoon the 26th Marines had to be released as the division reserve. The 5th Marine Division fought on Iwo Jima for a month, where they would sustain 1,098 killed in action and 2,974 wounded in action.

This proud outfit was the only Marine division never to serve within the continental United States and was the only division not reactivated for service following victory.

Multiple explanations for this nickname have been provided. Douglas MacArthur", once Chief of Staff of the 42ID, is often credited with the name. When the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, it needed to federalize the state National Guard units to quickly build up an Army. Political concerns soon complicated recruiting, and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker authorized a division to be organized with the best regiments from 26 different states. Major MacArthur, standing nearby," replied "Fine"," that will stretch over the whole country like a rainbow."\n\nWhen formed and activated for World War II", the 42ID was a unique unit, as it was a reconstitution of the Rainbow Division from World War I. Except for the division headquarters, none of its earlier elements had reformed in the interwar period, so the Army Ground Forces filled its new units with personnel from every state. From the division standup at Camp Gruber until the division stood down in Austria, at every formal assembly, the division displayed not only the National and Divisional Colors, but all 48 state colors (State Flags). To emphasize the 42ID lineage from the 42ID of World War I, Maj. Gen. Harry J. Collins activated the unit on 14 July, the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Champagne-Marne campaign in France.\n\nThe 42nd Division fought through the Rhineland and Central Europe, suffering over 5,000 casualties in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                   ,

Following its reactivation, the unit had gone through extensive training in the Mojave Desert in preparation for service against the Italians and Germans in North Africa.\n\nIn January 1943, after the Allied landings in North Africa, military commanders determined that there was no longer a need for the 7th's services in that theater. With the war in the Pacific beginning to ramp up, the division then began amphibious training on the beaches around Fort Ord.

Following the completion of Cartwheel, Sixth Army joined Australian Army and other US forces on the north coast of New Guinea. Similar in conception to the island hopping operations of the central Pacific, the object of the attacks was to land, establish a garrison and airfield which could support the next strike, and then move on.\n\nIn September 1944, Sixth Army was released from operations in New Guinea by the US Eighth Army. On 20 October 1944, X Corps and XXIV Corps, under Sixth Army, invaded Leyte in the Philippines. By December, Leyte was secured, and the Sixth Army was relieved again by Eighth Army to prepare for the invasion of Luzon. As a prelude to that invasion, the island of Mindoro was invaded by the Western Visayan Task Force comprising the 19th and 503rd Regimental Combat Teams. Sixth Army took part in the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945 with the subordinate units of I and XIV Corps. Sixth Army units fought south until they met up those of Eighth Army advancing from around Manila. Sixth Army then continued to clear the north of Luzon until the end of the war.

After succeeding there, Patton commanded the Seventh Army during the invasion of Sicily in July 1943 in conjunction with the British Eighth Army. Patton commanded the Seventh Army until 1944.\n\nThe Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern Sicily and captured the city of Palermo on 22 July and along with the British Eighth Army captured Messina on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured over 13,000 enemy soldiers. The headquarters of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and Algiers until January 1944, when Lieutenant General Mark Clark was assigned as commander and the Army began planning for the invasion of southern France.\n\nThe Seventh went on to fight in Southern France, the Vosges Mountains, Alsatian Plain, the Battle of the Bulge, Bastogne, and Colmar.  Ultimately, the Seventh Army went into the Saar, crossed the Rhine, captured Nuremberg and Munich, crossed the Brenner Pass and made contact with the US Fifth Army - once again on Italian soil. In less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 US and Allied Divisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                  ,

In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing the XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and the 11th Airborne Division on the other side of Manila Bay two days later. Combining with I Corps and XIV Corps of Sixth Army, the forces of Eighth Army next enveloped Manila in a great double-pincer movement. Eighth Army's final operation of the Pacific War was that of clearing out the southern Philippines of the Japanese Army, including on the major island of Mindanao, an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war.\n\nThe octagon in the insignia represents the numerical designation of the army and is in the colors of distinguishing flags for armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

General L.T. Gerow, the Fifteenth United States Army was the last field army to see service in Northwest Europe during World War II and was later the final command of General George S. Patton.\n\nThe Fifteenth Army served two separate missions while assigned to the area. During the later stages of World War II its mission was training and rehabilitating units and acting as a defensive line against counterattacks. After the war its mission was to carry out occupation duties and to gather historical information related to the European Theater of Operations, or ETO.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

EVTDESCMARNE930003;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Headquarters for the Sixth Army Group in Ajaccio, on the island of Corsica?\n\nHistorically: The Sixth Army Group was originally created in Corsica," France (specifically activated on 29 July 1944) as "Advanced Allied Force HQ", a special headquarters within AFHQ (the headquarters of Henry Maitland Wilson, the Supreme Commander Mediterranean Theatre) commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. Its initial role was to supervise the planning of the combined French and American forces which invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon and provide liaison between these forces and AFHQ.\n\nIn late 1944 and early 1945 the Sixth Army Group was involved in fierce fighting in the Alsace repelling the German advance during Operation Nordwind and subsequent pitched engagements closing off the Colmar Pocket.\n\nThe Army Group later advanced along the Swiss Border, then through Bavaria, and eventually into western Austria. The 63rd Infantry Division was the first Seventh Army unit to cross the Siegfried Line, and the first to get an entire division through it. The 3rd Infantry Division suffered the highest casualty count of all US divisions with over 27,000 casualties. In the Brenner Pass, elements of Sixth Army Group linked up on 5 May 1945 with the Fifth United States Army element of the Allied 15th Army Group advancing north from Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE930004;Formation of Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE930004;Allied Force Headquarters was the headquarters that controlled all Allied operational forces in the Mediterranean Theatre of World War II from late 1942 to the end of the war. It was established in the UK in August 1942 under General Dwight Eisenhower in order to command the forces committed to Operation Torch. Eisenhower had the title Commander-in-Chief, Allied Expeditionary Force. Shortly after the establishment of the headquarters," "Expeditionary" was deleted from its title for reasons of operational security. Eisenhower thus became Commander in Chief", Allied Force.\n\nBy the end of 1942, there was a need to unify command of the Allied forces in North Africa, since those from the west, landed during Operation Torch, and those from the east that had won the Second Battle of El Alamein were now close enough together to need coordination. Therefore, in February 1943, Allied Force Headquarters assumed control of the British Eighth Army advancing from the east as well.\n\nEisenhower remained in command of AFHQ until January 1944, overseeing the Allied invasion of Sicily, which began on 10 July 1943 and the Allied invasion of the Italian mainland, on 3 September 1943. He then returned to the United Kingdom to assume command of the forces assembling for Operation Overlord. He was succeeded by General Sir Maitland Wilson. Wilson's title became Supreme Commander, Mediterranean Theatre of Operations.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,
EVTNAMEMARNE930005;First Allied Airborne Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE930005;The First Allied Airborne Army was an Allied formation formed on 2 August 1944 by the order of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. The formation was part of the Allied Expeditionary Force and controlled all Allied airborne forces in Western Europe from August 1944 to May 1945. These included IX Troop Carrier Command, the XVIII Corps (Airborne), which controlled the 82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 17th Airborne Division and a number of independent airborne units, and all British airborne forces including the 1st Airborne Division and the 6th Airborne Division.\n\nFrom the time of its creation until the end of World War II, the formation commanded the Allied airborne forces that participated in the Allied advance through North-West Europe, including Operation Market-Garden in September 1944, repelling the German counter-offensive launched during the Battle of the Bulge between December 1944 and January 1945, and Operation Varsity in March 1945. The formation was then officially deactivated on 20 May 1945, with the British units under its command returning to the United Kingdom and the American units being renamed as First Airborne Army and taking over command of the American Zone of Occupation in Berlin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,
EVTNAMEMARNE930006;Pacific Theatre Command Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE930006;On 24 March 1942, the newly formed British and US Combined Chiefs of Staff issued a directive designating the Pacific theater an area of American strategic responsibility. On 30 March the US Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) divided the Pacific theater into three areas: the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), and the Southeast Pacific Area. Details and transition," including whether Nimitz "appointed" or "nominated" the commander of the South Pacific Area", were worked out between 3 April and formal assumption of the overall Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas by Nimitz on 8 May 1942.\n\nIn the separate South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur assumed command. The effective result of this organizational scheme was the creation of two separate commands in the Pacific: POA and SWPA, each reporting separately to the Joint Chiefs, each competing for scarce resources in an economy-of-force theater, and each headed by a commander in chief (CINC) from a different service. In particular, the division of the Solomons caused problems, since the battles of the Solomon Islands campaign in 19421943 ranged over the whole region, with the main Japanese bases in SWPA and the main Allied bases in SOPAC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE930007;Army Command Reorganization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE930007;In March 1942, there was a sweeping reorganization of the Army. This was the result of dissatisfaction with the existing structure, with the United States Army Air Forces in particular seeking greater autonomy. However, the main driver was the Chief of Staff, General George Marshall, who felt overwhelmed by the large number of officers and agenciesat least 61with direct access to him.\n\nThe Chief of Staff wanted no more than three commands reporting to him, so everything which did not fit into the Army Ground Forces or Army Air Forces became part of the Services of Supply, which were renamed the Army Service Forces on 12 March 1943," as it was felt that the term "supply" did not accurately describe their broad range of activities.\n\nNote to player: The three commands created by accepting this event confer small bonuses to land organization (AGF)", air organization (AAF), and supply throughput (ASF).  You will lose these bonuses if these units are renamed or destroyed however!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE930011;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Headquarters for the Alaska Department in Anchorage?\n\nHistorically: After the outbreak of war in Europe, General Staff planning for the defense of Alaska accelerated. By early 1940 the War Department had agreed on a long-range program having five major objectives: to augment the Alaska garrison; to establish a major base for Army operations near Anchorage, to develop a network of air bases and operating fields within Alaska, to garrison the airfields with combat forces, and to provide troops to protect the naval installations at Sitka, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor.\n\nIn October,1943," the War Department formed the "Alaska Department", to oversee these initiatives at a theater level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The corps made landfall in Morocco during Operation Torch as the Western Task Force under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, the first all-U.S. force to enter the European war.\n\nFollowing the successful defeat of the Wehrmacht under General Erwin Rommel in North Africa, I Armored Corps was redesignated the Seventh United States Army on 10 July 1943 while at sea en route to the Allied invasion of Sicily as the spearhead of Operation Husky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The three divisions were the amphibious landing force for the United States Fifth Fleet and were notably involved in the battles for Tarawa, Saipan, and Iwo Jima, during the war. The V Amphibious Corps was commanded by General Holland 'Howlin Mad' Smith followed by General Harry Schmidt.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,

EVTDESCMARNE999639;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the China-Burma-India (CBI) theatre command in Delhi, India?\n\nHistorically:\n\nChina Burma India Theater (CBI) was an umbrella term, used by the United States military during World War II for the China and Southeast Asian or India-Burma (IBT) theaters. Operational command of Allied forces (including US forces) in the CBI was officially the responsibility of the Supreme Commanders for South East Asia or China. However: US forces in practice were usually overseen by General Joseph Stilwell," the Deputy Allied Commander in China. The term "CBI" was significant in logistical", material and personnel matters. It was and is commonly used within the US for these theaters.\n\nWell-known US (or joint Allied) units in the CBI included the Chinese Expeditionary Force, the Flying Tigers, transport and bomber units flying the Hump, the 1st Air Commando Group, the engineers who built Ledo Road, and the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)," popularly known as "Merrill's Marauders".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                        ,

EVTDESCMARNE961000;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the 5th USAAF regional command in Brisbane, Australia?\n\nHistorically:\n\n14 B-17 Flying Fortresses that survived the Battle of the Philippines left Mindanao for Darwin, Australia, between 17 and 20 December 1941, the only aircraft of the Far East Air Force to escape. After its evacuation from the Philippines on 24 December 1941, FEAF headquarters moved to Australia and was reorganized and redesignated Fifth Air Force on 5 February 1942, with most of its combat aircraft based on fields on Java. It seemed at the time that the Japanese were advancing just about everywhere. The remaining heavy bombers of the 19th Bombardment Group, based at Malang on Java, flew missions against the Japanese in an attempt to stop their advance. They were joined in January and February, two or three at a time, by 37 B-17Es and 12 LB-30s of the 7th Bombardment Group. The small force of bombers, never numbering more than 20 operational at any time, could do little to prevent the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, launching valiant but futile attacks against the masses of Japanese shipping, with six lost in combat, six in accidents, and 26 destroyed on the ground.\n\nIt is the current U.S. Air Force's oldest continuously serving Numbered Air Force, providing over 70 years of continuous air power to the Pacific since its establishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE961001;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the 6th USAAF regional command in the Panama Canal area?\n\nHistorically:\n\nBy 1940, a rapid increase in the number of flying squadrons in both the Canal Zone as well as in Panama as a result of the preWorld War II mobilization of the Air Corps warranted a new organization, and the Panama Canal Air Force was created as a major command. After several organizational changes and the establishment of the United States Army Air Forces in 1942, Sixth Air Force became the controlling Air Force command authority for USAAF activities in the Caribbean, as well as in Central and South America. Through all these redesignations it was part of the Caribbean Defense Command, (10 February 1941  1 November 1947), which was the senior United States Army headquarters in the Canal Zone. The Caribbean Interceptor Command, was the Air Force component (10 February 1941  17 October 1941) of the CIC until being inactivated and replaced by VI Interceptor Command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Clarence L. Tinker, an Osage and career officer, was named Commander of the Seventh Air Force, and promoted to Major General in January 1942, the first Native American to reach that rank and the highest-ranking one in the Army.\n\nIn Hawaii, the command grew into a key position in the logistical organization of the Pacific war. One of the biggest elements of this organization was the Hawaiian Air Depot at Hickam, which served as an in-transit supply, repair, and modification center for force units scattered all the way to Australia.\n\nSeventh Air Force also became the hub of the Pacific aerial network. The command also played a major role throughout the Pacific War as a training, staging, and supply-center for air and ground troops.\n\nThe command deployed most of its combat units to the Central Pacific," where operations were best summed up by its air and ground views as "Just one damned island after another!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

Gen. Lewis H. Brereton. It had its headquarters at New Delhi. Components of the air force moved to India over a three-month period from March to May 1942. It was responsible for creating, operating and safeguarding the India-China Ferry, more commonly known as the Hump airlift, between 8 April and 1 December 1942, first with its Assam-Burma-China Command until 16 July, then the India-China Ferry Command until 1 December, when jurisdiction for the airlift passed to the Air Transport Command.\n\nThe Tenth Air Force conducted offensive strategic bombing operations in Burma and supported Allied ground efforts with close air support and operations against Japanese communications and supply installations. After the end of the war in China, the command headquarters departed from Shanghai on 15 December 1945, being attached to Army Service Forces at Fort Lawton, Washington where the last personnel were demobilized and the command inactivated, being returned to HQ USAAF on 6 January 1946.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It engaged in operations primarily in China.\n\nThe "Flying Tigers" of 14 AF (who adopted the "Flying Tigers" designation from the AVG) conducted highly effective fighter and bomber operations along a wide front that stretched from the bend of the Yellow River and Tsinan in the north to Indochina in the south"," from Chengtu and the Salween River in the west to both East and South China Seas and the island of Formosa in the east. They were also instrumental in supplying Chinese forces through the airlift of cargo across "The Hump" in the China-Burma-India theater. By the end of World War II", 14 AF had achieved air superiority over the skies of China and established a ratio of 7.7 enemy planes destroyed for every American plane lost in combat. Overall, military officials estimated that over 4,000 Japanese planes were destroyed or damaged in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II. In addition, they estimated that air units in China destroyed 1,100,000 tons of shipping,1,079 locomotives,4,836 trucks and 580 bridges. The United States Army Air Corps credits 14 AF with the destruction of 2,315 Japanese aircraft, 356 bridges,1,225 locomotives and 712 railroad cars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                    ,

EVTNAMEMARNE962000;National Registration Act of 1939;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE962000;The National Registration Act 1939 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. The initial National Registration Bill was introduced to Parliament as an emergency measure at the start of World War II. Royal assent given on 5 September 1939.\n\nThe Act established a National Register which began operating on 29 September 1939 (National Registration Day), a system of identity cards, and a requirement that they must be produced on demand or presented to a police station within 48 hours.\n\nThree main reasons for their introduction:\n\n1. The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy.\n\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions. The National Register was in fact an instant census and the National Registration Act closely resembles the 1920 Census Act in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                            ,

On 15 August 1945 this was expanded to include the rest parts of Dutch East Indies and southern part of French Indochina.\n\nOnce most of Burma was re-captured by Fourteenth Army, the command turned its attention towards its next major operational objective: Malaya. However, the use of atomic bombs on the Japanese mainland brought the war to an abrupt end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,

General Iwane Matsui was appointed as its commander-in-chief, concurrent with his assignment as commander-in-chief of the SEF. Matsui reported directly to Imperial General Headquarters. After the Battle of Nanjing, the CCAA was disbanded on February 14, 1938 and its component units were reassigned to the Central China Expeditionary Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

EVTDESCMARNE920102;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the South China Area Army HQ in Guangzhou (Canton) Historically:\n\nThe Japanese South China Area Army was formed on February 9, 1940 under the control of the China Expeditionary Army. It was transferred to direct control by the Imperial General Headquarters on July 23, 1940. Headquartered in Canton, it was responsible for direction of the Japanese invasion of southern China, garrisoning Japanese-occupied Guangdong Province and controlling military operations in neighboring Guangxi Province. It was disbanded on June 26, 1941 and its component units were reassigned back to the China Expeditionary Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE920103;Formation: Southern Expeditionary Army Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE920103;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Southern Expeditionary Area Army Group HQ in Saigon Historically:\n\nThe Southern Expeditionary Army was an army group of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was responsible for all military operations in South East Asian and South West Pacific campaigns of World War II.\n\nIt was formed on November 6,1941, under the command of Gensui Count Terauchi Hisaichi, with orders to attack and occupy Allied territories and colonies in South East Asia and the South Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE920104;Formation: 1st and 2nd Area Armies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE920104;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the First and Second Area Armies near Mukden Historically:\n\nThe Japanese 1st Area Army was formed on July 4, 1942 under the control of the Kwantung Army as a military reserve and garrison force to maintain security and public order in northern Manchukuo as many veteran divisions of the Kwangtung Army were transferred to the various southern fronts in the Pacific War. It consisted mostly of minimally-trained reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia, without adequate weapons or supplies. The 1st Area Army was headquartered in Dunhua, in what is now the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province, China.\n\nThe units of the 1st Area Army proved to be no match for the Red Army when the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo at the end of World War II. Without adequate armor, ammunition or leadership, many units broke and fled, or surrendered en masse. Many surviving soldiers of the 1st Area Army, including its commanding officer General Seiichi Kita, became prisoners in Siberia and other parts of the Soviet Union after the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945\n\nThe Japanese 2nd Area Army was formed on July 4, 1942 under the control of the Kwantung Army as a reserve and garrison force to maintain security and public order in Manchukuo. It was disbanded on June 13,1945, and its various components were reassigned to other commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                      ,

EVTDESCMARNE920105;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Eighth Area Army HQ near Rabaul Historically:\n\nThe Japanese 8th Area Army was formed on November 16, 1942 under the Southern Expeditionary Army Group for the specific task of opposing landings by Allied forces in Japanese-occupied Solomon Islands and New Guinea. It had its headquarters at Rabaul, New Britain and saw considerable combat in the Solomon Islands campaign, Bougainville campaign and New Guinea campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE920106;Formation: Siam Garrison Command;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE920106;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Siam Garrison Command near Bangkok Historically:\n\nThe 18th Area Army was originally formed on January 4, 1943 as the Siam Garrison Command. It was renamed the Japanese Thirty-ninth Army on December 14, 1944 and became the 18th Area Army on July 7,1945, shortly before the end of the Pacific War.\n\nThe 18th Area Army was under the control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group as a military reserve and garrison force, ostensibly to help defend the Empire of Japan's nominal ally, the Empire of Siam against possible invasion by the Allies, but in more practical terms, it was present to ensure that Siam remained an ally to Japan. It was headquartered in Bangkok.\n\nThe 18th Area Army was demobilized in Bangkok at the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945 without having seen combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE920107;Formation: Burma Area Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE920107;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Burma Area Army HQ near Rangoon Historically:\n\nThe Japanese Burma Area Army was formed on 27 March 1943, under the control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group as a garrison force to defend the nominally-independent State of Burma against reoccupation and re-colonization by British forces based in neighboring India.\n\nThe Japanese Burma Area Army was not equipped as other nominal units of comparable strength due to the dwindling external supply situation mainly because of increasing US and UK attacks on the Japanese naval supply lanes. As a result, many logistical requirements were locally purchased from Myanmar (Burma), Malai (Malaya), and Thailand. In 1943 the main responsibility of the BAA was to quell insurgencies of the Shan, Karen, and other tribal groups in the remote regions, and react to incursions of the Chindits from British India or Kuomintang forces from Yunnan.\n\nFor the campaign season of 1944, Lieutenant General Renya Mutaguchi, the commander of the Japanese 15th Army which at the time was assigned to the Japanese Burma Area Army, pressed for an offensive strategy. The resulting Battle of Kohima and Battle of Imphal were among the worst disasters ever suffered by the Imperial Japanese Army. In subsequent operations in the Burma campaign, the Japanese Army continued to suffer massive losses, and after the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay and Operation Dracula, was all but driven from Burma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEMARNE920108;Formation: Third Area Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE920108;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Third Area Army HQ near Mukden Historically:\n\nThe Japanese 3rd Area Army was formed on October 29, 1943 under the control of the Kwantung Army as a military reserve and garrison force to maintain security and public order in southern Manchukuo as many veteran divisions of the Kwantung Army were transferred to the various southern fronts in the Pacific War. It consisted mostly of minimally-trained reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia, without adequate weapons or supplies. The 3rd Area Army was headquartered in Mukden.\n\nThe units of the 3rd Area Army proved to be no match for the Red Army when the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo towards the end of World War II. General Jun Ushiroku refused orders from Kwantung Army Headquarters to retreat, and launched a counterattack along the MukdenPort Arthur railway, along which many Japanese civilians were fleeing. However, General Uchiroku was hampered by lack of armor and by insufficient ammunition, and by August 13,1945, his formations were largely shattered. A mutiny by the Manchukuo Imperial Army at Shinkyo ended his attempts to regroup. Many surviving soldiers of the 3rd Area Army, including General Ushiroku, became prisoners in Siberia and other parts of the Soviet Union after the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                       ,
EVTNAMEMARNE920110;Formation: Fifth Area Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE920110;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the Fifth Area Army HQ near Sapporo Historically:\n\nThe Japanese 5th Area Army was formed on March 16, 1944 under the General Defense Command as part of the last desperate defense effort by the Empire of Japan to deter possible landings of Allied forces in Hokkaido, Karafuto/South Sakhalin and the Chishima Islands/Kuriles during Operation Downfall (or Operation Ketsugo (Ketsugo sakusen) in Japanese terminology). It remained directly under the Imperial General Headquarters and was headquartered in Sapporo. The 5th Area Army leadership also held equivalent posts in the Northern District Army, and had the honor of receiving their appointments personally from Emperor Hirohito rather than the Imperial General Headquarters.\n\nAlthough the Japanese were able to raise large numbers of new soldiers, training and equipping them was more difficult. By August, the Japanese Army had the equivalent of 65 divisions in the homeland but only enough equipment for 40 and only enough ammunition for 30. The 5th Area Army consisted mostly of poorly trained reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia. In addition, the Japanese had organized the Patriotic Citizens Fighting Corps - which included all healthy men aged 1560 and women 1740 - to perform combat support, and ultimately combat jobs.

To do this the army, then based in Indo-China, needed to transit through Thailand. On December 8,1941, the 33rd and 55th Divisions of the army spearheaded by the Imperial Guard invaded Thailand overland from what is now Cambodia. The invasion was supported by landings on the coast to the south of Bangkok by the army's 143rd Infantry Regiment. Fighting lasted only a few hours before the Thai government ceded access.\n\nUnder Lieutenant General Shojiro Iida, the IJA 15th Army invaded the southern Burmese province of Tenasserim. The Fifteenth Army consisted initially of the highly regarded 33rd Infantry Division and the 55th Infantry Division. The latter attacked from northern Thailand, which had signed a treaty of friendship with Japan on December 21, 1941. The 15th Army quickly advanced through southern Burma, defeating the British and Indian Burma Army in several engagements, and capturing the capital of Rangoon by March 7, 1942.

However, the 51st Division, including the army's commander, Hatazo Adachi, and his senior staff, came under Allied air attack while en route from their supply base at Rabaul to Lae, in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. All eight transport ships and four destroyers were sunk with the loss of 3,664 men, and only 2,427 men of the division were rescued.\n\nOperation Cartwheel, an Allied master plan implemented from mid-1943, progressively severed the supply lines between Rabaul and frontline Japanese forces. Adachi's forces were badly affected by tropical diseases including malaria, heat exhaustion and malnutrition for the remainder of the war, despite Adachi's efforts to achieve some form of self-sufficiency by planting crops and giving priority in rations to the sick.

It was under the overall command of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army. Initially intended as a garrison force to withstand a long-term war of attrition, as the war situation on the Pacific front grew increasingly desperate for Japan, the Imperial General Headquarters ordered the bulk of the IJA 35th Army to Leyte as reinforcement to Japanese forces in the Battle of Leyte to fight against the combined American and Philippine Commonwealth troops. As the battle was lost, surviving units were given independent command authority, and were ordered to go to ground and wage a guerilla campaign on their respective islands for as long as possible. The IJA 35th Army was officially disbanded on April 19, 1945. Some individual Japanese stragglers did not give up until the 1970s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                          ,

The Japanese 40th Army consisted mostly of poorly trained and poorly armed reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia.In addition, the Japanese had organized the Patriotic Citizens Fighting Corps - which included all healthy men aged 1560 and women 1740 - to perform combat support, and ultimately combat jobs. Weapons, training, and uniforms were generally lacking: some men were armed with nothing better than muzzle-loading muskets, longbows, or bamboo spears; nevertheless, they were expected to make do with what they had.One mobilized high school girl, Yukiko Kasai, found herself issued an awl and told," "Even killing one American soldier will do ...

The Shimbu Group was officially re-designated the Japanese 41st Army on March 6, 1945. Yokoyama commanded Japanese forces defending Manila against the U.S. Sixth and Eighth Armies together with the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary including the recognized guerrilla groups. Following the Battle of Manila, Yokohama withdraw his surviving forces into the mountains of southern Luzon for a protracted ongoing Philippine Commonwealth military and guerrilla campaign, continuing to harass Allied forces until the surrender of Japan, by which time his army had been reduced to just 6,500 men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE920162;$MONARCHTITLE$, shall we form the 44th Army HQ near Tokyo Historically:\n\nThe Japanese 44th Army was initially raised in July 1941 as the Kwangtung Defense Army, an auxiliary force of the Kwantung Army based in the Manchukuo capital of Hsinking for public security and training. As the war situation on the Pacific front grew increasingly desperate for Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army transferred more and more experienced divisions and their equipment out of Manchukuo to other fronts. By early 1945, the vaunted Kwantung Army was largely hollowed out, and indications of a buildup of Soviet Red Army forces on the borders on Mengjiang and Manchukuo were alarming. The Kwantung Defense Army was renamed the Japanese 44th Army on May 30, 1945 and assigned to the Japanese Third Area Army, based in southern Manchukuo. It saw combat against the Soviet Army in Soviet invasion of Manchuria, with combat operations continuing into September, even after the official surrender of Japan. It was officially disbanded at Mukden, with many of its surviving troops becoming Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE9560;$MONARCHTITLE$," we are in a unique position to use our broad industrial base to create "Liberty Ships", for use in transporting men and war material to the front!  They carry substantially more cargo than a normal transport ship, and have slightly increased defences while at sea.  The downside is that we can't really use them for amphibious landings.\n\nHistorically: Liberty ships were cargo ships built in the United States during World War II. Though British in conception, they were adapted by the U.S. as they were cheap and quick to build, and came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output. Based on vessels ordered by Britain to replace ships torpedoed by German U-boats, they were purchased for the U.S. fleet and for lend-lease deliveries of war materiel to Britain and to the Soviet Union via deliveries through Iran. Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Libertys between 1941 and 1945, easily the largest number of ships produced to a single design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The squadron was known by the nickname Aguilas Aztecas or "Aztec Eagles", apparently coined by members of the squadron during training.\n\nThe squadron was attached to the 58th Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during the liberation of the main Philippine island of Luzon in the summer of 1945. The pilots flew Republic P-47D-30-RA Thunderbolt single-seat fighter aircraft carrying out tactical air support missions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                            ,

EVTDESCMARNE9562;$MONARCHTITLE$, the government of Canada is offering to assist us in our efforts in the Pacific Theatre by deploying The Royal Rifles of Canada and The Winnipeg Grenadiers to Hong Kong.\n\nHistorically: In Autumn 1941, the British government accepted an offer by the Canadian Government to send two infantry battalions and a brigade headquarters (1,"975 personnel) to reinforce the Hong Kong garrison. "C Force", as it was known, arrived on 16 November on board the troopship Awatea and the armed merchant cruiser Prince Robert. It did not have all of its equipment as a ship carrying its vehicles was diverted to Manila, Philippine Islands, at the outbreak of war.\n\nThe Canadian battalions were the Royal Rifles of Canada from Quebec and Winnipeg Grenadiers from Manitoba. The Royal Rifles had served only in Newfoundland and Saint John, New Brunswick, prior to their duty in Hong Kong, and the Winnipeg Grenadiers had been posted to Jamaica. As a result, many of the Canadian soldiers did not have much field experience before arriving in Hong Kong.\n\nRealizing that the battle was futile," ultimately the British forces in Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese on Christmas Day in 1941.  This day is remembered in Hong Kong as "Black Christmas".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTNAMEMARNE940000;Gen. Devers Appointed to Plan New Invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE940000;$MONARCHTITLE$, General Jacob Devers has been appointed to lead a team which will plan a possible diversionary invasion of Southern France.\n\nHistorically: Operation Dragoon was conceived almost simultaneously with Operation Overlord, the June 6. 1944 Normandy Invasion but, was shelved until the allies were assured of Overlords success. From the onset, Winston Churchill was vehemently opposed to the campaign. Churchill favoured increased prosecution of the Italian campaign and securing the Balkan oil producing regions. Denial of these regions to the Germans and to the Red Army reinforced Churchills disdain and mistrust of the Soviets and saw this as an advantageous negotiating tool in a post-war Europe.\n\nOverruled by the Allied Command Chiefs of Staff, Churchill begrudgingly acquiesced. The key to the campaigns absolute success was securing the much needed ports of Toulon and Marseilles. The Allies having a northern and southern supply line in France would trap the Germans in a pincer movement and drive them back into the Rhineland.\n\nOverall command was given to Lt. Gen. Jacob Devers of the U.S. 6th Army Group. Under Devers, the U.S. 7th Army, commanded by Gen. Alexander Sandy Patch, was comprised of the 3rd, 36th, 45th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Allied Airborne Task Force lead by Generals Lucien Truscott and Jean de Lattre de Tassigny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE960000;$MONARCHTITLE$," we have a need to consolidate existing government information services and deliver propaganda both at home and abroad.  We propose the creation of an "Office of War Information" to achieve these goals.\n\nHistorically: The OWI operated from June 1942 until September 1945. Through radio broadcasts", newspapers, posters, photographs, films and other forms of media, the OWI was the connection between the battlefront and civilian communities. The office also established several overseas branches, which launched a large-scale information and propaganda campaign abroad.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt promulgated the OWI on June 13, 1942 by Executive Order 9182 to consolidate the functions of the Office of Facts and Figures (OWI's direct predecessor), the Office of Government Reports, and the Division of Information of the Office for Emergency Management. The Foreign Information Service, a division of the Office of the Coordinator of Information, became the core of the Overseas Branch of the OWI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEMARNE960001;Why We Fight: Prelude to War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE960001;$MONARCHTITLE$, the renowned director Frank Capra has just released the first of seven commissioned propaganda films!\n\nHistorically: Why We Fight is a series of seven documentary films commissioned by the United States government for propaganda during World War II whose purpose was to show American soldiers the reason for U.S. involvement in the war. Later on they were also shown to the general U.S. public to persuade them to support American involvement in the war.\n\nMost of the films were directed by Frank Capra, who was daunted yet impressed and challenged by Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film Triumph of the Will and worked in direct response to it. The series faced a tough challenge: convincing a recently non-interventionist nation of the need to become involved in the war and ally with the Soviets, among other things. In many of the films, Capra and other directors spliced in Axis powers propaganda footage going back twenty years, and re-contextualized it so it promoted the cause of the Allies.\n\nWhy We Fight was edited primarily by William Hornbeck," although some parts were re-enacted "under War Department supervision" if there was no relevant footage available. The animated portions of the films were produced by the Disney studios  with the animated maps following a convention of depicting Axis-occupied territory in black.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTNAMEMARNE960002;Manpower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARNE960002;Manpower was a short propaganda film produced by the US Office of War Information in 1942. Made early shortly after America's entry into World War II, the film addressed the problems associated with the labor market adjusting for war time, such as people with the wrong skills rushing to a town looking for war work, and labor shortages in essential industries. The film discusses how the Roosevelt administration dealt with the problem by the establishment of the Federal Employment Commission, which brought together representatives from labor, management, and the military to organize war production effectively, the test case being in the city of Baltimore.\n\nIn spite of this action, there were labor shortages, and people had to be taken from other occupations and put into war work. Different examples are given and briefly dramatized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                         ,

EVTDESCMARNE960003;Henry Browne, Farmer is an American short propaganda film produced in 1942 about African-American contributions to the war effort during World War II. It is narrated by Canada Lee.\n\nThe film begins with stock footage of soldiers marching, tanks, and people in the war industries, the narrator noting that we had an army behind the troops in the war industries, and they had an army behind them, American agriculture. The story switches to a day in the life of Henry Browne, farmer. Henry Browne is 38 years old, married with three children. He makes his living off the land. When the sun comes up every member of the family has their chores to do. Little Henry goes to milk the cow, this is the first year they had a cow. His sister goes to feed the chickens, which are good layers," and the ones that aren't are good "eaters". Mrs. Brown tends the garden. There is little in the garden that will be sold", the narrator says, but much that will be eaten.\n\nHenry looks out into his field. He isn't planting what he usually plants, but peanuts like the government man asked. The peanuts will create peanut oil, contributing to the war effort. Henry Brown doesn't have a tractor, but only two mules.\n\nOn Saturday farmer Browne takes those same two mules and hooks them up to a carriage. Saturday is usually the day that farmers go to the market, but Henry has taken his whole family along this time. In fact, the mule-drawn carriage passes town altogether. The farmer isn't going to market today, but seeing his son  a Tuskegee Airman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                    ,

EVTDESCMARNE960005;The Arm Behind the Army is a propaganda film produced by the US Army Signal Corps in 1942 to encourage the home front to participate in war production.\n\nThe film begins with a short outline of American military history, noting that each war has advanced military technology a little further, from the muskets of 1776, to the tanks and airplanes of the First World War. The various arms of the US Army are introduced: infantry, artillery, air corps, signal corps. These are Uncle Sam's fist, the narrator notes," and behind it is American labor "Uncle Sam's muscle" the arm behind the army.\n\nThe narrator notes "Behind the desks", behind the drawing board, behind the benches, on the assembly lines," American industry is making the greatest production effort in history to supply our armed forces with the weapons of war."\n\nThe film briefly explains how dissension among Austrian and Czech management and labor led to the ruin of both", and how French factories were left idle while France fell. It noted the terrible working conditions in Axis-occupied territory, the coerced labor, the ending of old-age benefits," unions and "all the advances that labor every made." The film ends with a picture of a soldier and a picture of an industrial worker superimposed on a battlefield", noting that wherever the soldier is, the worker is there too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARNE960006;Negro Colleges in War Time is a short propaganda film produced by the Office of War Information in 1943. Other than in the title no reference is made to the students' race.\n\nThe film begins with a shot of the famous statue of Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee," and notes that "progress and industry" has a new meaning for the present -- winning the Second World War. A brief overview of the war related work at several different black colleges follows", starting with Tuskegee where the famous George Washington Carver was putting his brain to work for the war effort. Students are encouraged to join the Tuskegee Airmen or learn about aviation manufacture.\n\nAt Prairie View College in Texas and Howard University in Washington, DC students learn the increasingly technical skills of war industry and agriculture. At Howard's medical school," training is also being offered to supply the field with nurses. Hampton University in Virginia is "practically on a 24-hour basis training more war workers.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

EVTDESCMARNE960007;Black Marketing is a 1943 dramatic propaganda short produced by the Office of War Information and directed by William Castle. It is an educational film warning American civilians against buying unrationed foodstuffs and materials.\n\nThe film opens in a courtroom with the prosecutor laying the government's case against a syndicate of racketeers with names like Joseph B, Sam E, etc. Once the prosecutor starts to go into the time line of the case, the film dissolves into short segments showing the racketeers at work, how they organized themselves, bought up steers at inflated prices and forced butchers to distribute the illicit beef. They are caught, however, when one housewife is told that she can't buy a steak with her ration cards, but a woman after her does without them.\n\nThe butcher is taken by the OPA (Office of Price Administration) and interrogated. He is asked what his son in Africa would think if he knew his father were cavorting with saboteurs, and spills the beans about his accomplices. When the lawyer comes back, he looks to the audience and tells them that they too must not buy goods above the rationed price, and report it if they see it. A closing note tells the audience that everyone in the film is a law-abiding citizen who volunteered to act in the movie to educate the public about black marketing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                        ,

EVTDESCMARNE970037;The Air Corps began a rapid expansion in the spring of 1939 at the direction of President Roosevelt to provide an adequate air force for defense of the Western Hemisphere. An initial "25-group program", developed in April 1939, called for 50,000 men. When war broke out in September 1939 the Air Corps still had only 800 first-line combat aircraft and 76 bases, including 21 major installations and depots. American fighters were inferior to the British Spitfire and Hurricane, and German Messerschmitt Bf 110 and 109.\n\nFollowing the successful German invasion of France and the Low Countries in May 1940, Roosevelt asked Congress for a supplemental appropriation of nearly a billion dollars, a production program of 50,000 aircraft a year, and a military air force of 50,000 aircraft (of which 36,500 would be Army). Accelerated programs followed in the Air Corps that repeatedly revised expansion goals, resulting in plans for 84 combat groups,7,799 combat aircraft, and the annual addition to the force of 30,000 new pilots and 100,000 technical personnel.\n\nThe accelerated expansion programs resulted in a force of 156 airfields and 152,125 personnel at the time of the creation of the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1941.

EVTNAME48501;President Roosevelt is Dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC48501;Washington, April 12 - Franklin Delano Roosevelt, War President of the United States and the only Chief Executive in history who was chosen for more than two terms, died suddenly and unexpectedly at 4:35 P. M. today at Warm Springs, Ga., and the White House announced his death at 5:48 o'clock. He was 63.\n\nThe President, stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage, passed from unconsciousness to death on the eighty-third day of his fourth term and in an hour of high-triumph.

EVTDESC49288;"The German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres", OKH) originally planned an invasion on a vast scale, extending from Dorset to Kent. This was far in excess of what Kriegsmarine could supply, and final plans were more modest, calling for nine divisions to make an amphibious landing with around 67,000 men in the first echelon and an airborne division to support them. The chosen invasion sites ran from Rottingdean in the west to Hythe in the east.The German Navy wanted a front as short as possible as they regarded this as more defensible. Admiral Raeder wanted a front stretching from Dover to Eastbourne, stressing that shipping between Cherbourg/Le Havre and Dorset would be exposed to attacks from the Navy based in Portsmouth and Plymouth. General Halder rejected this, saying, From the army's point of view I regard it as complete suicide, I might just as well put the troops that have landed straight through the sausage machine. The battle plan called for German forces to be launched from Cherbourg to Lyme Regis, Le Havre to Ventnor and Brighton, Boulogne to Eastbourne, Calais to Folkestone, and Dunkirk and Ostend to Ramsgate. Fallschirmjägern (paratroopers) would land near Brighton and Dover. Once the coast was secured, they would push north, taking Gloucester and encircling London. There is reason to believe that the Germans would not attempt to assault the city but besiege and bombard it. German forces would secure England up to the 52nd parallel (approximately as far north as Northampton)," anticipating that the rest of the United Kingdom would then surrender.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

The stop lines were designated Command, Corp and Divisional according to their status.\n\nThe longest and most heavily fortified was the General Headquarters anti-tank line, GHQ Line, which ran across southern England, wrapped around London and then ran north to Yorkshire. It was intended to protect the capital and the industrial heartland of England. Another major line was the Taunton Stop Line, which defended against an advance from England's south-west peninsula. London and other major cities were ringed with inner and outer stop lines. Some 50 known stop lines were constructed in Britain, some of the less important lines were just demolition belts and not all lines were completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With his face red like a tomato and frothing at the mouth, Hitler accuses you of being a Bolshevik nincompoop. With spittle spraying, Hitler demands more supplies, more farms, more coal, and more money ! After 10 minutes of screaming at you," Hitler calms down and sends everyone else from the room. He whispers that no one can understand how difficult it is too be the Fuhrer and that only he knows what is best for Germany. However he will give you one more chance to get it right. Imploring you to think of Germany and not yourself "We all must make sacrifices"," I myself have given up Truffles and English tea" winks the Fuhrer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                          ,

He says he knows exactly what you are doing wrong and that he alone knows best the direction Germany should go. Hitler tells you to take a seat", pour a glass of his finest mineral water from Bavaria and listen up. He then launches into a nine hour reading of Mein Kampf," interspersed with long explanations as to why Germany must prevail along with the occasional bitching about Goring's eating habits and Himmler's "peculiar" habits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"                            ,

EVTDESC866627;Goering is at a high level meeting with Hitler at the Berghof. Over Truffles the two discuss the Luftwaffe and what is best for Germany. Goering wishes he had a few squadrons of the bombers the English are developing. Hitler isnt so sure, bombers are all well and good, but Germany might best be served by wonder weapons which leave the enemies cities smoking ruins. Hitler stares into his tea cup and mutters about how he would prefer a shipment of English tea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC866628;One bright morning Himmler and Hitler go for a stroll in the local woodlands. Hitler is partularily interested in a fresh batch of Truffles. Himmler has brought alone a number of pigs which he asssures the furher are excellent truffle hunters. They stop under a huge Oak and talk shop. Himmler complains at length about the endless revolts and threat of partisans. It seems no where is safe from infiltrators and sabatoures.

However Heinz knows his fuhrer too well and pushes for something more solid. Suddenly Hitler snaps and shouts out  "what you want and what you get are too completely different things!" Guderian leaves shaking his head in dismay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"
EVTDESC866630;Hitler has daily conferences with his Generals. He listens to battle reports and takes note of the demands fron different sectors of the front.

This war will be won by willpower and powerful weapons as well as the workers in the factories. We must all make sacrifices and put Germany first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC866631;Hitler stares balefully at Donitz as the great sea commander enters the room. 'I know what you are going to say', says the Fuhrer. 'You want more U boats, well the truth is i have been wanting to talk to you about this for a while now. I am not convinced U boats are the way to go. Personally i prefer something larger, and more impressive'. Donitz spends the rest of the evening listening to Hitler's obession with Battleships and naval guns. At last Donitz can reply and reminds his Fuhrer that Battleships are indeed impressive, but are not really worth the time and effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC866633;The Ural bomber was a program to develop a long-range bomber for the Luftwaffe, created and led by General Walther Wever in the early 1930s. Wever died in an air crash on June 3,1936, and the program ended almost immediately. Albert Kesselring took over his position in the Luftwaffe, abandoning most of his designs and turning others into tactical bombers. Choosing to focus on Tac bombers will grant certain tech bonuses but certain Strategic bomber technologies will nolonger be available;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC866634;The Amerika-Bomber project was an initiative of the German Reichsluftfahrtministerium, to obtain a long-range strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the continental United States from Germany, a distance of about 5,800 km (3,600 mi). Though the concept was raised as early as 1938, plans for such advanced, long range strategic bomber designs did not begin to appear in Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering's offices until 1942. All the strategic bomber technologies will now be available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

England and the English people are the naturel allies of Germany.  The third option is to allow Britain, under the right king, to leave to war and be independent.

EVTNAME136039;Presentation - Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC136039;In the 1930s, the Kingdom of Hungary relied on increased trade with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany to pull itself out of the Great Depression.  Hungarian politics and foreign policy had become increasingly pro-Fascist Italian and pro-National Socialist German because of this.  The partition of Hungary in accordance with the Treaty of Trianon  dominated the political life of Hungary during the period between World War I and World War II. Prime Minister Gombos advocates for a number of social reforms, one-party government and revision of the Treaty of Trianon, and Hungary's withdrawal from the League of Nations. He boasts that within two years he will have transformed Hungary into his own personal dictatorship. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                            ,
EVTNAME136040;Gyula Gombos Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC136040;Gombos never lived to see his ambitious plans come to fruition. Gombos, after a long bout with kidney disease, died of kidney failure in Munich on October 6, 1936. Kalman Daranyi substituted the diseased Gyula Gombos. After the Prime Minister's death the Regent Miklos Horthy appointed Daranyi to Gombos' successor on 12 October 1936. Darany wanted to recur to basis of Istvan Bethlen with the program of the conservation of the constitutional order, but he did not want to turn sharply against Gombos political testament. Although not sympathetic to the Hungarian fascists,  he pursued an increasingly authoritarian policy at home, and an alliance with the fascist powers Germany and Italy abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME136041;Bela Imredy forms New Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC126041;After it was discovered Kalman Daranyi secretly began to cooperate with Hungarian fascists, he was forced to resign. Imredy was appointed prime minister by Regent Miklos Horthy. Imredy attempts to improve Hungarys diplomatic relations with Britain initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. When Imredy realized that he could not afford to alienate the two fascist powers on a long term basis, however, his foreign policy became increasingly pro-German and pro-Italian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                            ,

EVTDESC136042;In February 1939, Imredys moderate political opponents, angered at his growing compliance to Germany and Hungary's right wing, presented evidence to Regent Horthy that suggested Imredys great-grandfather was Jewish. When Horthy confronted Imredy with the evidence, Imredy could not deny the claims about his heritage and resigned the premiership on 13 February 1939.  Pal Teleki was made Prime Minister by Horthy for the second time since 1921. A popular figure, he strove to close down several fascist political parties and distance himself from fascist powers Germany and Italy.  He pursued a strong policy of neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,
EVTNAME136043;Pal Teleki Suicides;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC136043;Germany planned to invade Belgrade and compel it to remain part of the Axis. Hitler used Hungary's membership in the Tripartite Pact of 1940 to demand that Hungary should also attack. Teleki had signed a non-aggression and 'Treaty of Eternal Friendship' with Yugoslavia on 12 December 1940, only five months previously, and would not assent to assisting in the invasion. Prime Minister Pal Teleki committed suicide with a pistol during the night of 3 April 1941 while German army had just started its march into Hungary.

Although Hungary remained allied with Nazi Germany, Kallay and Horthy were basically conservatives of the old school who were unsympathetic to fascism, and Kallays government refused to participate in the rounding up of Jews and other activities desired by the Nazis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x                           ,

EVTDESC50605;Straperlo was a business which tried to introduce in Spain in the 1930s a fraudulent roulette which could be controlled electrically with the push of a button. The ensuing scandal was one of the causes of the fall of the government and the polarization of the parliament, which led to the Spanish Civil War (19361939). The name had its origin in the names of the Dutch partners one of which was Daniel Strauss but sources differ on the exact name or names of the others. Some sources say there was just one other partner called Jules Perel. Some sources state there was a third female partner called Lowann who was the wife of Strauss. In 1935 they used their influence with the upper levels of the government to install the roulette in the casino Kursaal in San Sebastian but the police discovered the fraud and it was forbidden. As the business had invested a lot of money in the venture they tried to recover it by blackmailing the prime minister, Alejandro Lerroux, because his nephew was involved in the business and in the trafficking of influence. Lerroux refused to get involved and Strauss denounced the case to the president of the republic," Niceto Alcala Zamora who made it public. The reaction of the parties in the opposition caused the fall of Lerroux and his Radical Republican Party government. After the scandal and more so after the Spanish Civil War the word was incorporated as "estraperlo" into the Spanish language with the meaning of any business which is illegal or corrupt. Most often it refers to smuggling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x"

Later on", particularly under the Nanjing Nationalist Government they were re-organized in a system of Divisions, Corps and Armies.During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese occupied area was in continuous need for troops to suppress revolts and to defend against sabotage to the Japanese supply lines, which diverted much of Japan's regular army manpower. In order to solve its manpower shortage on the front line (especially after 1942 and the outbreak of the Pacific War), and maintain rule over already occupied areas in China, the Japanese began employing existing local soldiers and recruiting local people to be responsible for the occupied areas' public security. Accordingly, the Japanese occupied area puppet regimes established the North China Zhi'an Army and Nanjing collaboratist army. The various puppet regimes had nominal control over their own collaborationist army only, but Japanese military officers were authorized to command and transfer any collaborationist army units as they saw fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Japanese military recruited many young men from friendly tribes into service shortly before the start of World War II. The total number was confidential and estimates on the numbers recruited range from 1800 to 5000 men.

EVENTDESC88201;A bill has been proposed for the conscription of unmarried men into the CMF. Historically in 1939, conscription was introduced for unmarried men aged 21, unlucky to be that age in 1939, these men would train for three months in the CMF and would only serve in Australia or Australian territory such as Papua New Guinea. The issue of conscription wasn't a divided issue as it was in the Great War, so policies such as this one did not cause extensive controversy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVENTDESC88202;In the Great War, the issue of conscription divided Australia, in the Second World War with it's many threats has caused our nation to make the difficult decision to whether we will introduce conscription. Conscripting a large amount of our population will put strains on our industry and will distress our citizens, however to defend our shores, we will require manpower. If we wish to go all out on conscription, our economy, nation and research will suffer, but our army will gain the manpower it needs. Historically the Australian government introduced conscription for men 18 to 35 years of age, all single men aged 35-45 were required to join the CMF. Often professional and volunteer AIF troops teased conscripts espically CMF troops by calling them 'Chocos', men that 'melt' in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;                         ,
EVENTDESC88203;A proposal has been made to the parliament to solve our manpower and industry issue, we can keep the males being conscripted, but use the women at home for the industry, In the Boer War and the Great War, women supported the nation, so why can't they now? We should disband our conservative attitudes and adapt to our situation by being liberal and mature regarding it. Historically women and children had to face many tribulations at home without their lovers and husbands, shortages of food, disputes and fear were common issues women and children faced at home in Australia. By 1942, women entered the male orientated workplaces in unseen numbers and although were payed fewer rates, did a splendid job for the war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;                         ,
EVENTDESC88204;Should we allow women to set up their own organisations and possibly fund a few to support our front line, these organisations would sort out munitions, logistcs, repairs, signallers, transmitters, couriers, etc. Historically, many women set up independent and government funded organisations made to directly support the Australian Army, Navy and Airforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;                         ,
EVENTDESC88205;Women all over the nation are flocking to support our men in the air, they wish to support the RAAF by logistical, repairs, medical and other non-combative means.

They served with Royal Australian Artillery brigades on searchlight, coastal defence and anti-aircraft batteries and they often worked in very isolated areas in Australia and it's dominions. In 1947 they were disbanded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVENTDESC88209;Australia must be united for us to be a worthy asset in the war effort, this can be done with censoring anti-war or anti-Australian statements in the media and control manpower in the industry, effectively making Australia a state-controlled economy for the population designated. Historically anti-Australian or war statements were censored in newspapers, radio, movies, etc. In 1941, Australians could not make anti-war comments in public. The Act gave power to the Australian government to order men and women to work in certain industries, although women were payed less then men, they were required to work at their designated job or 'offend' the act, however prosecution wouldn't occur without 'written consent of the Attorney-General, or the Minister of State for Defence, or a person thereto authorized in writing by the Attorney-General or the Minister of State for Defence.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x;                        ,

EVENTDESC88212;We must decide whether to allow aboriginal and other ethnic minorities to be allowed to volunteer into the army and be applicable for conscription if the nation has it. In 1939 aboriginals weren't actually excluded from the Australian Armed Forces, perhaps due to the low numbers initially, however in 1940 the Defence Committee of Australia decided to exclude aboriginal enlistment due to it being 'neither necessary not desirable'. Aboriginals were not seen in large numbers in the AIF until the Japanese entry into the war where aboriginal exclusion was lessened. Many European Australians were fervently against aboriginal inclusion into the Australian Armed Forces due to the possibility that they would guide Japanese troops through Papua New Guinea and Australia and other assistance for personal gain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVENTDESC88213;The AIF was extremely biased towards European individuals, Aboriginals, Asians, Africans, etc were excluded from the Australian Armed Forces.

EVTDESC49022;Sissi is a Finnish term for light infantry which conducts reconnaissance, sabotage and guerrilla warfare operations behind enemy lines.In wartime, an unspecified number of reservists assigned to Sissi battalions would deploy and operate as small groups up to company size. They are meant to stay behind and covertly operate against enemy forces in their area of responsibility even if regular friendly troops have been forced to retreat. Sissi battalions are part of Finnish Army local troops, unlike the jäger and armored brigades meant for operational use. Sissi units are considered as the elites of the Army conscripts. After the outbreak out of hostilities, five Sissi Battalions (Sissipataljoona) were formed from 'auxiliary personnel'. These battalions especially those of the latter type, were below their nominal strength in both men and weaponry.

EVTNAME85000;German Economy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85000;You are in your office perusing a giant map of Europe when your secretary knocks. 'Reichsmarshall Goering is here to see you, sir,' she says, and before you can even stand straight the portly Luftwaffe chief enters, wringing his hands. 'I know he is very pleased with the rate of growth of the economy,' he says, 'but it has to be reigned in soon. Bubbles will burst.' He is covered in a thin sheen of sweat. You reassure him that everything is going according to plan," and he sees himself out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85001;German Economy 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85001; You're settling down to enjoy the congratulatory tea and biscuits Hitler sent you recently when the phone rings. From the heavy breathing alone you know it's Reichsmarshall Goering. 'You must stop this!' he begs. 'You're not the one responsible for the economy, I am! It's all bouquets and chocolates now,"," sure,", but what will happen when the masses are out of work once more? They got us into power - they can take us out of it!' From the other room, Reichsminister Goebbels pops the cork on some champagne," and you decide to hang up on Goering to join the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85002;German Economy 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85002;You sit at your desk with your head in your hands. National stockpiles are depleting fast, unemployment is soaring, the Reichsmark plumetting in value. You have seven missed calls from the Reichschancellery. Your secretary, having just been sacked," hands you a final telegram from the Reichsmarshall. 'I warned you!' it declares. 'It's on your head now.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85003;German Economy Recovers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85003;The campaign was fought nobly by the troops, unaware of the tension in the government. The vital seizure of resources from the capitals of Europe might just be enough to keep the economy afloat. You attend the meeting of Hitler's inner circle and are treated with stone-cold silence. Hitler and Goebbels won't look at you, but Goering gives you a long stare from across the table," his lips pursed in a grimace. You have kept your head - for now - but it is clear you are no longer trusted the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7900;With tensions rising around the World we need to prepare our budget for bigger spendings on all branches of our military and industry. \n\n    For now our budget is fine. We don't need make any adjustments for now, but once our army or industry starts growing we will have move funds around to make sure we have enough money to actualy pay our men. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7901;Our military budget analysts from Ministry of Finance didn't predict our army growing this much in so short time. Because of that we need to tap into emergency funds to be able to pay for uniforms, new equipment, ammunition and of course salaries. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7902;Army is still demanding more money. Despite already going over budget, Army officials demand bigger percentage of total budget to make sure that they have enough to cover all expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7903;At this point it can't be a surprise that our Ministry of Finance received a letter from Ministry of War asking for more money. Unfortunately there's not much we can do except simply paying to avoid affecting morale of our troops in a negative way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7904;More money! This is most common thing that can be heard from the offices of Ministry of War. Lets hope this will pay off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7905;This is slowly becoming ridiculous. As always generals don't even care about the fact that our country has countless other expenses to deal with. Only thing that matters is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7906;Some people in Ministry of Finance started placing bets on when it will stop. Drainage of money seems to be endless. More we give, more they spend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7907;With Army budget being already blown to gargantuan proportions spending more money on that seems to be at the same time insane and only option... We can just hope our economy can handle that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7908;It's becoming a matter of time when some other institutions figure out how much our Army costs and they start demanding similar treatment. When that happens - our economy will be doomed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7909;"I hope you choke on it" - This is what Minister of Finance said when he signed hopefuly last "request" for increased Army spending. Future will tell if his wish came true.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7910;In one of the toilets in Ministry of Finance someone wrote on the wall: MILITARY SPENDING TRAIN HAS NO BRAKES! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7911;Air Forces are still relatively new branch of any army and their importance is still growing so getting a bit more financing shouldn't be a problem for our budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7912;Our Air Forces requested increased funding. No other branch of our military rised any objections so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7913;Well, another request for more money. To be fair we are expanding our air forces more than initialy planned so them needing more money shouldn't be a surprise. At least for now our budget can handle that without any major issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7914;Yet another request from Air Forces. This time some people in the Ministry of Finance voiced their concerns about amount of money required to keep our Air Forces well equipped and payed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7915;Our Air Forces keep spending all the money we're throwing at them. Pretty much without any limits or seconds thoughts. And now they're asking for more. Again! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7916;And of course they want more. We gave them enough funding to expand more than any other branch of our armed forces and yet it's still not enough for them . At first no one had any problems with that, but with each consecutive budget adjustment we can hear more negative opinions about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7917;It didn't took that long for them to come to us and ask, at this point, already boring question. It's getting more and more risky to keep increasing spending like that without any second thoughts or control over how those money are spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7918;NO! Enough is enough! - yelled Minister of Finance. Problem is that with war upon us the fact that increasing spending so greatly on just one branch of our army might eventualy ruin our economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7919;This day started as most our days do. Wake up, breakfast, coffee, trip to the office, morning mail, letter asking for more funding send by one of the airforces HQ's, Minister going furious, picking up pieces of said letter from the floor, typing polite response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7920;Everyone expects that we will just make bills magicaly multiply. That we will keep economy afloat no matter what. Don;t they understand that budget is not an endless well which you can't drain without any limits?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7931;We just received information that our navy reached the spending limit for this quarter. It was bound to happen considering our naval expansion. That little bit of money we need to spend on that now won't be an issue .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7932;Being constantly asked about additional funds is part of Minister of Finance job description. Today it was the navy. They overextended themselves "a bit" in terms of wages and equipment spending and came to ask if it's possible to get more funding. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7933;Our navy has build more warships. Nothing surprising. Another thing that isn't surprising at all is that they came to us for more funds to actualy to able to pay the crews of those warships. Because they couldn't be bothered to think about that few months ago when budget was still an open matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7934;Guess what happened? Getting funds for dozens of new warships wasn't enough. According to some admirals our navy needs new, modern vessels. Cost is not a concern for them for most of the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7935;With more and more ships being put into service it was a matter of days until someone from the navy showed up with proposition of adjusments to existing budget. As to be expected, it included rises in spendings on everything related to the navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7936;Sometimes it looks like they don't even care or realise that we might need money for other expenses. Yes, Navy came asking for more money. Because what they're getting now is still not enough! Maybe it's time to do the piracy thing again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7937;Another day, another beggar. Navy this time. It's what Sisyphus must've felt. One day we somehow make economy work again and next day, first thing in the morning, they basicaly ask us if they can leech it a bit more which eventualy leads us into another crisis. And we start all over again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7938;Navy send us a letter. Realy polite one. Well put, reasonable, lots of actualy valid, not made up arguments. Of course it's about money and how much they need more, but, my God. This letter is a masterpiece of polite requests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7939;I think they sensed it's working. Navy send us another letter. Even better than the last one. It actualy feels wrong now to decline when they try so hard to get more funding. It sounds almost... honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7940;Well... Even the most polite requests can sometimes cross the limits and ask for too much. And many people in our office started to believe it is already too much. It will be difficult to fit even bigger spendings on the navy somewhere in between other expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7951;Our industry grew bigger. It's now giving and employment to more and more people across our country. But they won't work for free. No one will. That's why we need to adjust budget to allow us to spend more money on wages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7952;Current situation required increasing production output. Army needs more artillery, airforces need more planes and so on. It's impossible to achieve without increasing our workforce. This obviously requires also bigger spendings on wages. Not much we can do to avoid that. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7953;Someone, up on the higher positions of our government, decided that our industry has to be bigger. They didn't asked any questions. They just told us to make it happen from financial side. Do we even have a choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7954;More factories equals more workers equals much more money needed for wages. Not to mention maintenance of factory equipment and many other things. And yes, we have more and more factories with each passing month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7955;It should be pretty obvious by now, that our budget is a bit stretched. But some people in the governemnt can't somehow comprehend that. They decided that our industry needs to expand at any cost. Problem is that they don't care about that "cost" part of entire idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7956;"Give them a finger, and they'll take the whole hand" seems to be perfectly valid thing to say right now. It's hard to find reason behind the decision to increase spending in this area, but aparently our job in Ministry of Finance is simply to make money appear out of thin air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7957;This time Minister wanted to say no. He realy tried. Thing is that even before he started talking, he was pretty much threatened by combined delegation from governement and few biggest factories directors, with riots and strikes. What can we do in situation like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7958;With recent events still in mind our boss just sat down, leaned back and said "Fuck it. No matter what I do they'll fire me eventualy. I sign the documents, economy goes to shit, they'll say it's because I don't do my job. I don't sign the documents, they'll say that I sabotaged war effort or I'm simply not a patriot and they'll sack me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7959;It's like playing Russian Roulette right now. With semi-auto pistol. We either ruin the economy or we get fired. That's what our job ended up to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7960;Eh... Just spam more IC will ya? Oh, you play USA and you got all that IC from events? Noob. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC696976;The British Army is attacking! Will our defences hold?! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC147113;Toshio Ota (20 March 1919  21 October 1942) was a World War II Japanese fighter ace. In early 1942, at the age of 22, he flew a Mitsubishi A6M Zero with the Lae based Tainan Air Group. There the young petty officer, 1st class became one of the so-called "Clean-up Trio" of Japanese aces, along with his squadron mates Saburo Sakai and Hiroyoshi Nishizawa. Ota's first confirmed kill, of a U.S. Army Air Force P-40E Warhawk, was over New Guinea on April 11, 1942. Transferred to Rabaul in August, Ota was killed in a dogfight with U.S. Marine Corps Grumman F4F Wildcats over Guadalcanal on October 21, shortly after shooting down a Wildcat himself. His victorious opponent is believed to be 1st Lt. Frank C. Drury of the VMF-212 squadron. Ota is credited with 34 victories, making him the Imperial Japanese Navy's sixth-ranking ace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC147114;Lieutenant Junior Grade Tetsuzo Iwamoto (15 June 1916 - 20 May 1955) was one of the top scoring aces among Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) fighter pilots.[1] He entered the Imperial Navy in 1934 and completed pilot training in December 1936.

EVTDESC147116;Hiromichi Shinohara (1913  1939) was the highest-scoring fighter ace of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAF).[1][2] On 27 June 1939 he set a Japanese record by downing 11 planes on a single day. He was shot down and killed on 27 August 1939, having claimed 58 victories in only three months of combat. He scored all his aerial victories while flying a Nakajima Ki-27. Shinohara's luck however ran out on him two months later when on 27 August 1939 he himself was shot down by Soviet Polikarpov I-16 fighters after claiming three victories during a bombing escort mission. His aircraft fell in flames into Mohorehi Lake, ten kilometres south of Abdara Lake. Warrant Officer Hiromichi Shinohara was posthumously promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, having claimed 58 victories in only three months of combatthe last three in the battle that would take him downearning him the nickname of the Richthofen of the Orient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC147117;Lieutenant Junior Grade Hiroyoshi Nishizawa (27 January 1920  26 October 1944) was an ace of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during World War II. He is officially credited in Japan with 36 aerial victories. It is possible that Nishizawa was the most successful Japanese fighter ace of the war He personally claimed to have had 102 aerial victories at the time of his death. Some uncertainty is due to the Japanese habit of recording victories for pilots' units, rather than the individual, after 1941, as well as the often wildly exaggerated claims of aerial kills that were frequently accepted. Some sources credit Nishizawa with over 120 to 150 victories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9300208;The Greater East Asia Co-prosperity put forth an alternative, ideological basis and a new unifying, organizational principle to articulate the multiple military, political, economic, cultural, and ethnic ties between Japan and Asia. Within the bloc, co-prosperity would replace the Wilsonian ideal of Open Door in East Asia.\n\nIn place of the liberal principles of self-determination and self-interest of the individual Asian countries within the international economy, reformists advanced the principle of coexistence of the Asian peoples within a self-sufficient bloc.\n\n[PLAYER NOTES]: The more nations we integrate into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere the more bonuses and events we will have, up to 5 nations. The valid nations are Korea, Manchukuo, Mengjiang, Republic of China-Nanjing, Siam, India, Burma, Indochina, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be a valid puppet these must control their industrial base, not be a rump state. Puppeting nations results in less control over their logistics, naval and air bases which may make them less usable as bases of operation, choose who to puppet carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
