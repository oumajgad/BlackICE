EVTDESC98000;President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey passed away on November 10, 1938. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was a Turkish army officer, revolutionary, and the first President of Turkey. He is credited with being the founder of the Republic of Turkey. His surname, Atatürk (meaning "Father of the Turks"), was granted to him in 1934 and forbidden to any other person by the Turkish parliament.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC980001;The province of Dersim had been a difficult one for Turkey to control, dating back to the Ottoman period. The local Kurdish rulers, Aghas, resisted the Kemalist policies of the new Republic of Turkey, which favoured ethnic Turks at the expense of Kurds. The Turkification process of the province began in earnest in 1934, with the resettlement of ethnic Turks and the eviction of Kurdish Alevis, and the renaming of Dersim to Tunceli. Kurdish children were sent to schools out of the region and encouraged to be Turkified through marriage and education. The Aghas resisted these measures along with increased taxation and as the Turkish military began to expand, public sentiment rapidly soured and soon the province was in open rebellion. Turkey deployed tens of thousands of troops to the region and began a campaign of aerial bombardment. Over three campaigns stretching into September 1938, the Turkish military killed anywhere between 13,000 and 70,000 Kurds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980002;The Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980002;In October 1939, Britain and France looked to Turkey as part of their Mediterranean strategy. They saw Turkey as vulnerable to aggression and wanted to safeguard it with a view to potentially using it as a strategic partner. To this end, they signed a treaty which guaranteed Turkish borders and to come to its aid in the event it was attacked by a 'European aggressor.' To sweeten the deal, both Britain and France agreed to import tobacco and foodstuffs such as dried fruits from Turkey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980003;The Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980003;Britain and France look to improve their relations with us. Due to the rising threat of Italy in the Balkans and the alignment of Romania towards Germany, it may be a good idea to look to the Entente for protection, as it is no longer clear if we can stand on our own or if our Balkan allies can uphold their commitments to our defence. If we sign this treaty, Britain and France will come to our aid if we are attacked, and we can make some money by selling them tobacco and foodstuffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME980005;The German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980005;Germany began negotiating with Turkey in April 1941. During this time, the Golden Square Coup took place in Iraq, which saw Germany request military access through Turkey. Turkey in response wanted border concessions from Iraq. These negotiations were still underway when the British suppressed the coup fully by June. As a result, Germany and Turkey instead signed a 'friendship treaty' which saw Germany agree to respect Turkish territorial integrity, promising no measures against one another, and improved relations for future commercial agreements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980006;The German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980006;Germany has approached us with an offer of friendship. They pledge to respect our territory. This is a good sign as developments in the Balkans and North Africa have made it more plausible that we could be dragged into this war. Signing the treaty will also open up the chance to negotiate commercial agreements with the Germans in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980007;The Clodius Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980007;In October of 1941, Turkey and Germany signed the Clodius Agreement. Turkey agreed to supply Germany with chromium ore, totalling 270,000 tons over three years, contingent on Germany's own supply of military and industrial equipment to Turkey. Germany supplied over 100 locomotives and 1000 freight cars, as well as tanks, planes and rifles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME980008;The Clodius Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC980008;Germany has suggested a trade deal whereby they will provide us with substantial amounts of industrial, logistical and military equipment in exchange for our raw materials. This will help us with our own rearmament substantially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
