# Marneman's Port Blockade System
#
# First let me say that this is so not how I wanted to implement this thing.
# However, because of the limitations of the scripting engine, I was forced to
# resort to some rather lengthy conditionals.
#
# In short, the blockade system works like this.  Player parks his naval units
# in a sea province which is adjacent to a land province with a port (naval
# base).  When the check event fires, each major AI nation who is at war with the
# player checks to see if the player has moved into this blockade position
# with his naval forces.  If so, ALL ports that connect to the sea zone will
# suffer a temporary reduction of its effective port level.  Thus reducing the
# amount of supplies and other materials that can be transferred into the
# port.
#
# When the blockade is in effect, a province modifier will be applied to the
# port, as well as a "blockaded" province flag.  The modifier will keep
# getting applied as long as the player continues to maintain the blockade.
#
# When the blockade is lifted by the player's fleet either leaving the
# province, getting wiped out, etc., the province modifier will expire.  That
# makes the port is eligible to be cleaned up by the AI-only "janitorial" event,
# which will remove the province flag as well.  That is what triggers the port's
# original level to be restored.
#
# There is generally a delay from the time the blockading fleet leaves to the
# time the port's natural level is restored.  This is abtracted as the time it
# takes for the port to reorganize itself after the blockade.
#
# Note: These events will work with ports up to level 20

# TODO LIST:

# - Multiple levels of blockades depending on how long the blockader has been in place
