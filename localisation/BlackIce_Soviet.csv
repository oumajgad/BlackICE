Historical_upgrades_decision_desc;This decision will give you access to historical units for the Red Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC11000;This decision will give you access to historical units for the Red Army.

strategic_command_decision_title;Forming the Longe Range Air Command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strategic_command_decision_desc;This decision will give access to some Red Airforce units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC11001;The first three Air Armies, designated 'Air Armies of Special Purpose' were created between 1936 and 1938. The 1st was created on March 1st 1936, the 2nd Air Army was created on March 15th 1937 in the Far East. Somewhat later, the 3rd Air Army was created in the North Caucasus Military District. However, air armies were excluded from the organisational reform of the air forces approved on July 25th 1940. On November 5th 1940, the three existing air armies were reformed as the long range bombardment aviation of the Stavka of the Red Army due to poor combat performance during the conflict with Finland.\nYou can manually attach this Command to the Moscow MD theatre, as this is the closest to the Stavka.\n\nFrom May - November 1942, seventeen Air Armies were created from the air forces of the Fronts and Combined Arms Armies, and in December 1944 a long-range aviation Air Army was created as the 18th Air Army. The 1st Air Army was the first created, on May 5th 1942, as part of the Western Front. The next to form during 1942 were the 2nd, 3rd, 4th (May 22nd 1942), 5th, 6th 8th Air Armies (June 1942), 9th/10th/11th/12th (August 1942), 7th and 13th Air Army (November 1942), 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th Air Armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

T-35_decision_title;Form the 5th Separate Heavy Tank Brigade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
T-35_decision_desc;This decision will give access to a Red Army unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC11002;The first T-35s formed the 5th Separate Heavy Tank Brigade in Moscow, and paraded on May 1st 1936 on the Red Square. They apparently did not participate in the border wars in Mongolia, the invasion of Poland or the Winter War. By June 1940, they were seen as nearly obsolete and costly to operate, and the question was raised of their demobilization, conversion, or assignation to military academies. They were eventually transferred to the 8th Mechanized Corps in the Kiev district (Ukraine), into the 67th and 68th Tank Regiments of the 34th Tank Division. In the summer of 1941, 90% of these tanks were lost due to mechanical breakdowns, lack of maintenance, fuel, and often sabotaged by their crews, abandoning them. These figures can be explained by the tank's sheer size and the fact it was overweight for its engine and transmission (similar to the T-28). A few surviving vehicles were recorded during the battle of Moscow during the winter of 1941-42.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It took part in the Winter War as a reinforced rifle division and was almost destroyed during the battle of Suomussalmi. Remnants of the units were removed to Novgorod and used to make a motorized division, assigned to the 1st Mechanized Corps (1940).\nThe 173rd Rifle Division was raised in Balashov (Volga Military District) in September 1939.

Units were not trusted and deployed in the close vicinity of other Soviet units, to avoid desertion. These 3 corps suffered heavy losses and were disbanded after the German invasion of the Baltics.

EVTDESC13207;GC3 'Normandie Niemen' was an fighter unit made of Free French who were sent to the Soviet Union to fight Germany alongside the Soviet Union. After long and tedious negociations between French and Soviet officials, a small group of French pilots and mechanics arrived in Russia in late 1942, and it was decided that they will fly Soviet fighters - the Yak-1 and later Yak-3.\n\nAssigned to the 6th Air Regiment of the 1st Soviet Air Army, GC3 'Normandie' fought its first campaign (March 1943 - November 1943) before being converted into a full air regiment for the later stages of the war. In June 1945, a Stalin Decree gave the French pilots permission to return to their conuntry with their planes. From 1943 to 1945, 'Normandie Niemen' flew over 5240 combat missions, getting 273 confirmed kills for the loss of 38 KIA or MIA.\n\nMany French pilots distinguished themselves in this unit, notably the unlikely tandem of Marcel Albert (23 kills) and Roland de la Poype (16 kills), one from a humble worker's background and the other from an aristocratic family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC13208;As a result of the Mutual Assistance Pact of March 12th, 1936 and the involvement of Soviet forces in the Battle of Khalkin Gol (Summer 1939), Mongolia provided supplies and raw materials to the Soviet military during WW2. From June 1941, until the end of 1945, the USSR imported from Mongolia 0.7 million heads of cattle, 4.9 million heads of small cattle, 0.5 million military horses, almost 6 million pieces of small leather.\nBy February 1942, Vneshtorgbank of the USSR received funding from the MPR for the construction of tanks, estimated to a total of 3.8 million rubles. In January 1943, Marshal Horloogiyn Choibalsan led a delegation of the MPR into Soviet Union for the gift of Mongolina funded tank column made of 34 T-34/76 and 21 T-70 tanks. They were transfered to the 112th Tank Brigade, renamed as the '112th Red Banner Tank Brigade Revolutionary Mongolia'.\nIn March 1943, following the presentation of the 'Revolutionary Mongolia' tank brigade to the Red Army, MPR officials announced their intention to fund a fighter squadron within the Soviet Air Force. The squadron was given 12 Lavochkin La-5 fighters in a formal ceremony and formed part of the 2nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment.\nAlso, more than 300 Mongolian volunteer military personnel fought in the Eastern front while Mongolia kept 10% of its population under arms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC14015;In September 1941, Stavka started to attribute the title of "Guards" to units of the Red Army that distinguished themselves during the war. Guards status was more than just a decoration and had practical benefits for those in such units: enlisted personnel in Guards units received double pay compared to those in other units, and non-commissioned officers and above received 1.5 times the pay of their counterparts in other units. Such rewards meant that it often acted as a morale booster and increased unit cohesion. Guards status also resulted in higher priority for replacements and equipment than normal units.\n\nA first batch of 3 Guards Rifle divisions was attributed on September 18th 1941 to units in the Moscow vicinity.\n\nThe 1st Guards Order of Lenin Rifle Division was formed by renaming the 100th Rifle Division.\n\nThe 2nd Guards Taman Rifle Division was formed by renaming the 127th Rifle Division.\n\nThe 5th Guards Gorodok Rifle Division was formed by renaming the 107th Rifle Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
