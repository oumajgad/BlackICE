zDD_ITA_guerrilla_offensives_1_desc;The Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia was an armed struggle fought from the summer of 1941 to the autumn of 1943 by remnants of Italian troops in Italian East Africa, following the Italian defeat during the East African Campaign of World War II. When General Guglielmo Nasi surrendered the last troops of the Italian Colonial Army with military honors in East Africa at Gondar in November 1941, many Italians decided to start a guerrilla war in the mountains and deserts of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. \n\nNearly 7,000 Italian soldiers participated in this fight against the British army in the hope that the German-Italian Army of Rommel would win in Egypt making the Mediterranean an Italian "Mare Nostrum" (Our Sea) and retake the recently-occupied territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With the assistance of the Taisei Yokusankai political party, the Tonarigumi, and Great Japan Youth Party, units were created by June 1945. Some 28,000,000 men and women were considered 'combat capable' by the end of June 1945. At this stage of the war, the lack of modern weaponry and ammunition meant that most were armed with swords or even bamboo spears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC70001;The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair, were two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the German  Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) to dictator Adolf Hitler. As documented in the Hossbach Memorandum, Hitler had been dissatisfied with these two highest ranking military officials and regarded them as too hesitant towards the war preparations he demanded. Using blackmail and false accusations both senior military officials were forced to resign. \n\nHitler used the situation to transfer the duties of the Ministry of War to a new organization, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW). He then took advantage of the situation by replacing several generals and ministers with people even more loyal to him, taking more effective defacto control of the Wehrmacht which he de jure commanded.

EVTDESC88827;Operation Panzerfaust, known as Unternehmen Eisenfaust in Germany, was a military operation to occupy the Kingdom of Hungary conducted in October 1944 by the Wehrmacht. When Adolf Hitler received word that Hungary's Regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy, was secretly negotiating his country's surrender to the advancing Red Army, he sent commando leader Waffen-SS Lieutenant-Colonel Otto Skorzeny to Hungary. The Parliament then voted Szálasi as Prime Minister and Head of State. During Szálasi's rule, Hungarian tangible assets (cattle, machinery, wagons, industrial raw material etc.) were sent to Germany. He conscripted young and old into the remaining Hungarian Army and sent them into hopeless battles against the Red Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC93661;The 1938 FIFA World Cup was the third staging of the World Cup, and was held in France from 4 June to 19 June. France was chosen as hosts by FIFA in August 1936. Italy retained the championship, beating Hungary 42 in the final.\n\nFIFA's decision during the celebration of the 1936 Summer Olympics to hold the tournament in France caused outrage in South America where it was believed that the venue would alternate between the two continents. Instead, it was the second tournament in a row to be played in Europe. As a result neither Uruguay nor Argentina entered the competition. Spain became the first country to be out of the World Cup because of a war (the Spanish Civil War).\n\nIt was the first time that the host (France) and the title holder (Italy) qualified automatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC91727;The Jarrow March (or Jarrow Crusade, from the phrase on banners carried by the marchers), was an October 1936 protest march against unemployment and extreme poverty suffered in North-East England. The 200 marchers travelled from the town of Jarrow to the Palace of Westminster in London, a distance of almost 300 miles (480 km), to lobby Parliament. Their MP, Ellen Wilkinson, known as 'Red Ellen', walked with them. When the marchers completed their feat, very little was done for them.

A Mulberry Harbour was a type of temporary harbour developed in World War II to offload cargo on the beaches during the Allied invasion of Normandy. \n\nTwo prefabricated artificial military harbours were taken across the English Channel from Britain with the invading army in sections and assembled off the coast of Normandy as part of the D-Day invasion of France in 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC91729;By 9 June, just 3 days after D-Day, two harbours codenamed Mulberry 'A' and 'B' were constructed at Omaha Beach and Arromanches, respectively. They were towed across the English Channel by tugs to the Normandy coast at only 4.3 Knots, built, operated and maintained by the Corps of Royal Engineers. The Royal Engineers  built a complete Mulberry harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had 10 miles (15 km) of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port 'Winston' is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of military engineering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC91730-STORM;A large storm on 19 June destroyed the American harbour at Omaha, leaving only the British harbour which came to be known as Port Winston  at Arromanches. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected (due to it not being securely anchored to the sea bed), Port Winston saw heavy use for 8 monthsdespite being designed to last only 3. In the 10 months following D-Day, it was used to land over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tonnes of supplies providing much needed reinforcements in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Also in France was a separate long-range RAF force, the Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF).  The BEF, commanded by General Lord Gort, although constituting only a tenth of the defending Allied force, sustained heavy losses during the German advance and most of the remainder (roughly 330,000 men) were evacuated from Dunkirk between May 26 and June 4.\n\nIf you choose to send the BEF, you have to send at least 5 divisions to any northern french port from Brest to Dunkerque before the fall of Paris.\n\nIf Paris falls before you send the units, you will suffer heavy dissent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Bethune is best known for his service in war time medical units during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and with the People's Liberation Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). A Communist, he wrote that wars were motivated by profits, not principles. \n\nA frequent cause of death on the battlefield is medical shock  brought on by loss of blood. A casualty whose wounds do not appear life-threatening suddenly dies. Bethune conceived the idea of administering blood transfusions on the spot. He developed the world's first mobile medical unit. The unit contained dressings for 500 wounds, and enough supplies and medicine for 100 operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME91810;Great Depression in the United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91810;The Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash of October, 1929 and rapidly spread worldwide. The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement. Although its causes are still uncertain and controversal, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future.\n\nIndustries that suffered the most included construction, agriculture, shipping, mining, and logging as well as durable goods like automobiles and appliances that could be postponed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME91811;Recession of 19371938;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91811;The Recession of 19371938, sometimes called the Roosevelt Recession, was a temporary reversal of the pre-war 1933 to 1941 economic recovery from the Great Depression in the United States. Economists disagree about the causes of this downturn. Keynesian economists tend to assign blame to cuts in Federal spending and increases in taxes at the insistence of the US Treasury, while monetarists, most notably Milton Friedman tended to assign blame to the Federal Reserve's tightening of the money supply in 1936 and 1937.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It also responded to the success of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act passed in 1935.\n\nThe act was the first to make price support mandatory for corn, cotton, and wheat to help maintain a sufficient supply in low production periods along with marketing quotas to keep supply in line with market demand. It established permissive supports for butter, dates, figs, hops, turpentine, rosin, pecans, prunes, raisins, barley, rye, grain sorghum, wool, winter cover-crop seeds, mohair, peanuts, and tobacco for the 1938-40 period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He and other government officials had high hopes that German athletes would dominate the games with victories. The German athletes achieved a 'top of the table' medal haul. Meanwhile Nazi propaganda promoted concepts of 'Aryan racial superiority' and depicted ethnic Africans as inferior.\n\nOwens surprised many by winning four gold medals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME91814;United States Housing Authority;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91814;The United States Housing Authority, or USHA, was an agency created during 1937 as part of the New Deal.\n\nIt was designed to lend money to the states or communities for low-cost construction. Units for about 650,000 low-income people but mostly homeless were started. Progressives early in the 20th century had argued that improving the physical environment of poorer citizens would improve their quality of life and chances for success.\n\nThe private sector saw an economic danger in nationalized housing, and insisted that there be a clear difference between the main housing industry and welfare programs focused on people too poor to buy, but who were worthy and deserved help. There was a concerted effort in the words of Senator Robert F. Wagner, at 'avoiding competition' between the private and public sectors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It applies to employees engaged in interstate commerce or employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, unless the employer can claim an exemption from coverage. The FLSA established a national minimum wage, guaranteed 'time-and-a-half' for overtime in certain jobs, and prohibited most employment of minors in 'oppressive child labor', a term defined in the statute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Roosevelt requested the policy of 'cash and carry' replace the Neutrality Acts of 1936.\n\nThe revision allows the sale of material to belligerents, as long as the recipients arranged for the transport using their own ships and paid immediately in cash. The purpose was to hold neutrality between the United States and European countries, while still giving material-aid to Britain. Various policies forbade selling implements of war or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms. The economic situation in the US was rebounding at this time (after the Great Depression) but there was still a need for industrial manufacturing jobs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To that end, the Joint Planning Board developed a new series of war plans, the 'Rainbow' plans.\n\nRainbow 1 was a plan for a defensive war to protect the United States and the Western Hemisphere north of ten degrees [south] latitude.

EVTDESC91820;A state of emergency is a governmental declaration that may suspend certain normal functions of government, alert citizens to alter their normal behaviors, or order government agencies to implement emergency preparedness plans. It can also be used as a rationale for suspending civil liberties.

EVTDESC91821;The U.S. mobilization pace picked up in the wake of German military successes in the spring of 1940. This phase, usually called the defense period, represented a transitional stage similar to the one envisioned by the abandoned industrial mobilization plan. In May 1940 Roosevelt called for 50,000 new aircraft and a supplemental defense appropriation. \n\nHe also set up an Office of Emergency Management in his executive office to coordinate the effort, and he revived the Advisory Commission of National Defense to assess problems of mobilizing resources and to prepare comprehensive plans for various stages of mobilization. But the commission itself did not last the year, and its successor, the Office of Production Management, was also soon abolished. The political climate was still not receptive to full-scale industrial mobilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC91822;President Roosevelt's signing of the STSA (Selective Training and Service Act) on September 16, 1940 began the first peacetime draft in the United States. It also established the Selective Service System as an independent agency responsible for identifying and inducting young men into military service. \n\nRoosevelt named Hershey to head the Selective Service on July 31, 1941 where he remained until removed by President Richard Nixon in 1969. This preparatory act came when other preparations, such as increased training and equipment production, had not yet been approved. Nevertheless, it served as the basis for the conscription programs that would continue to the present. The act set a cap of 900,000 men to be in training at any given time and limited military service to 12 months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It was announced in a radio broadcast on December 29, 1940, a year into World War II and a year before being attacked, at a time when Nazi Germany had occupied much of Europe and threatened Britain. \n\nRoosevelt referred to Detroit, Michigan as 'The Great Arsenal of Democracy' because of the rapid conversion of much of the Detroit-area automotive industry to produce armament during World War II. The speech was 'a Call to Arm and Support' the Allies in Europe, and to a lesser extent, China in their all-out war against Germany and Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC88925;The Kingdom of Iraq was governed by the United Kingdom under the British Mandate of Mesopotamia from the fall of the Ottoman Empire at the end of WWI until 1932 when Iraq gained nominal independence.  Before gaining independence, however, Iraq had signed the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty which included giving the United Kingdom full military access to facilities and bases to allow for unrestricted movement through the country for British military.  \n\nThe biggest impact of this treaty was to ensure UK control of all of Iraq's oil resources, something that many Iraqis resented.  The treaty also required both Iraq and the United Kingdom to aid one another in the event of war and effectively placed the United Kingdom in charge of Iraqi foreign policy (represented in-game by the large neutrality increase).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC88926;On March 31, 1941, spurred on by pro-axis propaganda from the Italian Legation in Baghdad as well as the exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Arab nationalist Rashid Ali A-Gaylani organized a coup d'état that overthrew the regime of Regent 'Abd al-allah and installed himself as Prime Minister.  It was led by four Iraqi army generals who were known collectivally as 'The Golden Square'.

EVTDESC88927;When Italy joined the war against Britain, Iraq did not break off relations as they had with Germany.  Consequently, the Italian diplomatic presence in Baghdad became a center for pro-Axis propaganda and worked to foment anti-British sentiment.  This, combined with the desire of the Golden Square generals and Rashid Ali to use the war to press for full Iraqi independence, led to increased tensions. The situation came to a head when Iraqi forces surrounded the RAF base at Habbaniya on April 30, 1941, and demanded a halt to all base operations.  \n\nBy May 1, the situation had not resolved and Churchill gave Air Vice-Marshal Sharp full authority to take any steps needed to ensure the withdrawl of the Iraqi forces.  With the approval of London and without issuing an ultimatum, Sharp decided to launch air strikes against the Iraqis.  The Anglo-Iraqi War had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In this context the uprising in Iraq is of special importance.

EVTNAME70286;Anti-facist Korea Resistance Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70286;The Korean resistance movement grew out of the Japanese colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945. There was no main strategy or tactic that was prevalent throughout the entire resistance movement, but there were prominent stages where certain tactics or strategies were prominent throughout the movement. \n\nThere were broadly three kinds of national liberation groups: the religious groups which grew out of the Confucianist and Christian communities, the former military and irregular army groups, and business and intellectual expatriates who formed the theoretical and political framework abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70287;Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70287;The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was an anti-Japanese guerrilla army in the Northeast part (Manchuria) of China after the occupation of Manchuria by Japan in 1931. It was organized by the Manchurian branches of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \n\nHowever, it lost direct contact with the CCP headquarters in Yanan, and was supported by the Soviet Union and the Comintern. Many Korean communists and anti-Japanese activists who defected to Manchuria joined NAJUA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC70101;The Partisans fought an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the Axis occupiers and their local collaborators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70102;The Croatia Partisans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70102;The Ustae's (Croatian Revolutionary Organization) politics provoked mass movements of resistance inspired in part by royalist (Cetnik) and  more effectively  communist (Partisan) ideologies, but driven primarily by a determination to fight back by any means. \n\nThe uprisings were particularly strong in rural areas where many village populations fled from the terror and then mounted guerilla operations from vantage points in the mountains and forests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70104;The Albania Partisans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70104;The Albanian Resistance of World War II was a movement of largely Communist persuasion directed against the occupying Italian (until 1943) and then German forces in Albania, which led to the successful liberation of the country in 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70107;La Résistance Française;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70107;The French Resistance is the name used to denote the collection of French resistance movements that fought against Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy régime. \n\nRésistance cells were small groups of armed men and women who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70108;Norwegian resistance movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70108;The Norwegian resistance to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany began after Operation Weserübung in 1940 and ended in 1945. It took several forms: Asserting the legitimacy of the exiled Norwegian government, and by implication, the lack of legitimacy of Vidkun Quisling's pro-Nazi regime and Josef Terboven's military administration. \n\nThe initial defense in Southern Norway, which was largely disorganized, succeeded in allowing the legitimate government to escape capture, and mounted armed resistance in the form of sabotage, commando raids, assassinations, special operations  and stirred civil disobedience and unarmed resistance during the occupation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70109;Danish resistance movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70109;The Danish resistance movement was an underground insurgency movement to resist the German occupation of Denmark. Due to the unusually lenient terms given to Danish people by the Nazi occupation authority, the movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries. However, by 1943, many Danes were involved in underground activities ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70110;Belgian Resistance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70110;Belgian resistance to their occupation by Nazi Germany took different forms. 'The Belgian Resistance' was the common name for the Netwerk van de weerstand - Réseau de Résistance or Resistance Network (RR), a group of partisans fighting the Nazis. Belgian resistance fighters performed various roles, including sabotaging Nazi installations and helping rescue downed Allied fliers. As much of the rail traffic between northern Germany and France passes through Belgium, another role played by networks with radios was to provide the Allies with intelligence on movements of troops and materiel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70111;The Holland Resistance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70111;Dutch resistance to the Nazi occupation can be mainly characterized by its prominent non-violence, aiding over 300,000 people in hiding tended-to by some 60,000 illegal landlords and caretakers. It developed relatively slowly, but its counterintelligence, domestic sabotage, and communications networks provided key support to Allied forces beginning in 1944 and continuing until the Netherlands was fully liberated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70112;Greek Resistance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70112;The rise of resistance movements in Greece was precipitated with the invasion and occupation of Greece by Nazi Germany and its allies, Italy and Bulgaria, from 1941 to 1944. The first major resistance group to be founded was the EAM  (National Liberation Front), a political movement. By 1944 EAM became the most powerful Resistance Movement in Europe, with more than 1,800,000 members. The Greek population was around 7,500,000 at that time.  EAM was organized by the Greek Communist Party (KKE) and other smaller parties, but all the major political parties refused to participate either in EAM or in any other Resistance Movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70120;La Résistance soutient les débarquements!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70120;On mainland France itself, from the onset of the D-Day Normandy landings in June 1944, the FFI and the communist FTP movements, theoretically unified under the command of General Pierre Knig, fought alongside the Allies to free the rest of France. \n\nSeveral colour-coded plans were co-ordinated for sabotage, with the most important being Plan Vert (Green) for railways, Plan Bleu (Blue) for power installations and Plan Violet (Purple) for telecommunications. To complement these missions, smaller plans were prepared: Plan Rouge (Red) for German ammunition depots, Plan Jaune (Yellow) for German command posts, Plan Noir (Black) for German fuel depots and Plan Tortue (Tortoise) for road traffic. \n\nThe paralyzing of German infrastructure is widely thought to have great effect. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later wrote in his memoirs of the huge role the Résistance played in the liberation of Brittany. The French Resistance Movement, which here numbered 30,000 men, played a notable part, and the peninsula was quickly overrun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC70430;The T-34 tank posed new challenges for Soviet industry. It had heavier armour than any medium tank produced to that point, and sub-assemblies originated at several plants: Kharkov Diesel Factory No. 75 suppling the model V-2 engine, Leningrad Kirovsky Factory (former Putilov works) making the original L-11 gun, and the Dinamo Factory in Moscow producing electrical components. Tanks were initially built at KhPZ No. 183, in early 1941 at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory (STZ), and starting in July shortly after the German invasion at Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112 in Gorky, (now called Nizhny Novgorod).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME300;German troops enter Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC300;German troops marched into Paris in the early hours of this morning as French and allied forces retreated. \n\nThe enemy met no resistance as it entered the capital, which was declared an open city yesterday by the city's French Military Governor, General Hering. French troops withdrew to avoid a violent battle and the total destruction of Paris. They are believed to have taken a new line of defence south of the city. \n\nThe Germans advanced from the north-east and north-west and shortly afterwards tanks rumbled past the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs Elysees to the Place de la Concorde.  All shops and businesses in Paris have been closed and shuttered and there are unconfirmed reports the French government has now left Tours, in central France, and gone further south to Bordeaux. The enemy has been advancing toward Paris since they took Dunkirk ten days ago, forcing a huge evacuation of the port, resulting in thousands of allied deaths and casualties. \n\nAs the Germans approached, the French premier, Paul Reynaud broadcast an appeal for all free-men to come to the aid of France. British troops arrived south of Paris and began fighting alongside their French counterparts day and night to stem the advance of the Germans. The RAF has spent the past few days bombing German convoys, supply columns, mechanised units and lines of communications. All the bridges behind enemy lines from Rouen to Mantes have been destroyed by the RAF to stop the enemy bringing up material and reserves. German aircraft responded with air raids east of Paris and at Evreux and Mantes, west of the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until 14 May 1940 when the main Dutch forces surrendered. However, Dutch troops in the province of Zealand continued to resist the Wehrmacht until 17 May when Germany completed its occupation of the whole nation. \n\nThe Battle of the Netherlands saw one of the first major uses of paratroopers in occupying crucial targets prior to ground troops reaching the area. The German Luftwaffe  utilized paratroopers in the capture of several major airfields in the Netherlands in and around key cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague in order to quickly overrun the nation and immobilize Dutch forces. \n\nThe battle ended soon after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam  by the German Luftwaffe and the subsequent threat by the Germans to bomb other large Dutch cities if Dutch forces refused to surrender. The Dutch General Staff knew it could not stop the bombers and surrendered in order to prevent other cities from suffering the same fate. The Netherlands remained under German occupation until 1945, when the last Dutch territory was liberated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It took place over an 18 day period in May 1940 and ended with the German occupation of Belgium following the surrender of the Belgian Army. \n\nOn 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht, Germany's armed forces, invaded Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and Belgium under the operational plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). The Allied Armies attempted to halt the German Army in Belgium, believing it to be the main German thrust. After the French had fully committed the best of the Allied Armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a break-through, or sickle cut, through the Ardennes and advanced towards the English Channel. \n\nThe German Army (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied Armies. The Germans gradually reduced the pocket of Allied forces, forcing them back to the sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To prevent civilians from fleeing the city, he ordered troops to guard the port, as instructed by Chiang Kai-shek. \n\nThe defense force blocked roads, destroyed boats, and burnt nearby villages, preventing widespread evacuation. The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the President left on December 7, leaving the fate of Nanking to an International Committee led by German businessman John Rabe.\n\nThe defense plan fell apart quickly. Those defending the city encountered Chinese troops fleeing from previous defeats such as the Battle of Shanghai, running from the advancing Japanese army.

The Latvian resistance movement was divided between the pro-independence units under the Latvian Central Council and the pro-Soviet units under the Central Staff of the Partisan Movement in Moscow. Around 22,000 deserted both from the Red Army and German Army during 194345 in Latvia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90315;Belarus partisans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90315;The Soviet authorities considered Belarus to be of importance to the development of the Soviet partisan war from the very beginning. The main factors were its geography, with lots of dense forests and swamps, and its strategic position on communication lines going from Moscow to the West. In fact, Belarusian Communist bodies in the Eastern provinces of Belarus began to organise and facilitate organisation of the partisan units on the day after the first directive was issued. \n\nBy Soviet estimates, in August 1941, about 231 detachments  were operating already. 'Seed' units, formed and inserted into Belarus, totaled 437 by the end of the 1941, comprising more than 7,200 personnel.  However, as the front line moved further away to the east, conditions steadily worsened for the partisan units, as resources ran out, and there was no large-scale support from beyond the front until March 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90318;Alongside Belarus, Ukraine was the first and hardest hit by the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer and autumn of 1941. The consequences for the area and for the population that remained under the occupation were devastating. The Nazi regime made little effort to exploit anti-Soviet sentiments among the Ukrainians that developed from the years of Stalinist rule. Under these circumstances most of the population resisted the Nazi onslaught and the partisan movement spread over the occupied territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2104;Transfer Industry to Siberia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2104;When the onslaught by the Germans began, Soviet army groups in the west were quickly overrun and the remainder of the Red Army had to rapidly devise a plan for defense. Soviet leadership decided that the Red Army had to slow down the German advance and force their armies to spread out as thinly as possible. This would make it possible to launch a counter-offensive during the next year. It was also decided that this plan would buy the Soviets time to dismantle heavy industrial facilities in the west and move them to Siberia in order to maintain production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90305;Total Axis forces available for Barbarossa were on the order of 3.9 million men.  On 22 June, the German Wehrmacht achieved a local superiority in its initial assault with 98 German divisions. Included in this number were 29 armoured and motorized divisions, some 90% of German mobile forces, attacking on a front of 1,200 km (750 mi) between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains, against NKVD border troops and the divisions of the Soviet First Operational Echelon (the part of the First Strategic Echelon stationed immediately behind the frontier in the three western Special Military Districts) because it had completed its deployment and was ready to attack about two weeks before the Red Army was scheduled to have finished its own deployment with the Second Strategic Echelon in place. At the time, 41% of stationary Soviet bases were located in the near-boundary districts, many of them in the 200 km (120 mi) strip around the border;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90305;Hold the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90306;The Red Army  was dispersed and unprepared, and units often separated and without transportation to concentrate prior to combat. Although the Red Army had numerous, well-designed artillery pieces, some of the guns had no ammunition. Artillery units often lacked transportation to move their guns. \n\nTank units were rarely well-equipped, and also lacked training and logistical support. Maintenance standards were very poor. Units were sent into combat with no arrangements for refueling, ammunition resupply, or personnel replacement. Often, after a single engagement, units were destroyed or rendered ineffective. The army was in the midst of reorganizing the armor units into large tank corps, adding to the disorganization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME70300;PRESENTATION-AUSTRALIA;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70300;Australia was borne in 1901 when the six self governing colonies and the Northern Territory joined together in federation as an independent nation under the British Monarchy becoming a dominion of the British Empire. Australia entered onto the world stage in 1915 during the Gallipoli landings in the Great War and Australian forces contributed heavily to the war effort afterwards taking almost 200,000 casualties.  \n\nAfter the war, Australia received a League of Nations mandate for the German colonies in New Guinea which added to the formerly British, now Australian-colony, becoming know as Papua New Guinea. \n\nWhen the Great Depression hit, Australias economy was hit especially hard with the second highest unemployment rate at peak, second only to Germany's. This caused massive government cuts, leaving the RAN, RAAF and Army in a poor state by 1936 with the threats of an expansionist Japan and resurgent Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70301;Sir Isaac Alfred Isaacs Retires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70301;Isaac Alfred Isaacs (6 August 1855  11 February 1948) was Australias ninth Governor General, serving from January 1931 to January 1936. A former judge, he was the first Governor General to be born in Australia. His appointment had been the subject of some controversy due to this and was resisted by King George V due to the belief that an Australian would not be able to act impartially in the position. \n\nThe appointment was however reluctantly approved on the insistence the Australian Labour Prime Minister James Scullin. Serving through the depression he was well liked. When he retired in 1936 he was replaced by Alexander Gore Arkwright Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, a veteran of Sudan and the Great War and a recipient of the Victoria Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70302;Arkwrights Term Ends;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70302;Alexander G. Arkwright's term as tenth Governor General ended in September 1944.  He was popular and unobtrusive and was noted for his tour of the Netherlands East Indies which was the first time the Governor General represented Australia abroad and in that he was the longest serving Governor General, serving 9 years. Though the Labour Party had a stated policy of appointing Australians to the position, Prime Minister John Curtin decided that due to the circumstances appointing a British-borne person would have the advantages of strengthening ties with Britain, making it clear that Australia was not a US vassal and preventing an outcry from the Conservative opposition. The position was eventually filled by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME70303;Henry returns to Britian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70303;Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, third son of King George V, served as 11th Governor General from January 1945 to Early 1947, he was known for travelling with his wife in their private plane.  In Early 1947 he was required to return to Britain to fulfill his duties as regent while King Gorge VI was in South Africa. He left his plane as a gift to the Australian people.  The Labour Party leader of the time, Ben Chiffley, decided to appoint an Australian-borne as 12th Governor General and chose William John McKell, who was at the time of the decision still the Premier of New South Wales leading a Labour government. There was an outcry from the conservative press and opposition and some resistance to the move in London. Chiffley however insisted and King Gorge VI appointed McKell to the position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME72000;Death of Joseph Lyons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72000;On the 7th of April 1939, Joseph Lyons, the 10th Prime Minister of Australia, died suddenly from a heart attack. He was the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office. Sir Earle Paige was nominated by the Governor General as caretaker Prime Minister until a permanent replacement was elected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME72001;Election of Robert Menzies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72001;On the 26th of April 1939 Robert Menzies was voted in as the head of the United Australia Party, thereby being chosen as Australias 12th Prime Minister. His government was immediately thrown into crisis when Earle Page, leader of the Country Party, refused to serve under him, accusing him of cowardice for not having enlisted to serve in the Great War. This ended the UAP-Country Party coalition. Menzies resolved the crisis by forming a minority government and the coalition was reformed a few months later after Earle Paige lost the leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME72002;Robert Menzies Resigns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72002;During 1941 Prime Minister Robert Menzies spent several months in England discussing war strategy with Winston Churchill. When he returned to Australia he found that due to his disregard for the threat of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific his party had lost all support for him. He was forced to resign as Prime Minister and was replaced by Arthur Fadden who was sworn in as Australias 13th Prime Minister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC72003;When war broke out in 1939, Australian Law restricted any part of the Citizen Military Force from being deployed overseas. The Australian Government created the Australian Imperial Force to honour its commitment to the Allies. As in the First World War, this force was to be entirely made up by volunteers. When forming the initial divisions the Australian Government was overwhelmed with volunteers, allowing them to choose the best and fittest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC72004;The 6th Australian Division was the first division formed as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force.

The type 93 was the designation for the 24" torpedoes fired from surface ships. The smaller 21 type 95 was used in submarines.  The type 93 had a longer range, faster speed, and larger warhead than any allied torpedo during the war.

EVTNAME91824;Faulty Mk 14 Torpedo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91824;The Mk 14 torpedo was designed in 1930 to serve in the new USN fleet submarines. Included in it's design was the top secret Mk VI magnetic exploder. Inexplicably the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) neglected to conduct a single live-fire test of the new torp. A design flaw with the magnetic exploder which caused it to detonate prematurely was revealed early on during the war. \n\nThis lead sub commanders, against orders, to make use of the backup contact exploder, which itself commonly failed to detonate on direct angle shots. Furthermore the torpedo ran 10 feet deeper than it was set, and would sometimes run circular. \n\nAt least one US sub was lost to its own torpedo, the USS Tullibee, sunk in March of 1944. The similar Mk 15, used by surface ships, suffered the same problems. This would lead to severe setbacks for the USN early in the Pacific War. Our submarines and escort vessels will lose some anti-ship and convoy firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
