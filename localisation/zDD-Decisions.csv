Operation_Market_Garden_desc;Operation Market Garden was an Allied military operation fought in the Netherlands and Germany between September 17th and the 25th, 1944. It was the largest airborne operation of all time. The operation plan's strategic context required the seizure of bridges across the Maas (Meuse River) and two arms of the Rhine (the Waal and the Lower Rhine) as well as several smaller canals and tributaries. \nCrossing the Lower Rhine would allow the Allies to outflank the Siegfried Line and encircle the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. It made large-scale use of airborne forces whose tactical objectives were to secure a series of bridges over the main rivers of  German-occupied Netherlands and allow a rapid advance by armoured units into Northern Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Battle_of_the_Bulge_desc;The Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive, launched through the densely forested Ardennes Mountains region of Belgium, France and Luxembourg. The Wehrmacht's code name for the offensive was "Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein" (Operation Watch on the Rhine), named after a German patriotic hymn. The German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as "Unternehmen Bodenplatte", "Unternehmen Greif", and "Unternehmen Währung".\n\nGermany’s planned goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capture Antwerp, and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis Powers’ favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Operation_Husky_title;Operation Husky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Operation_Husky_desc;The Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, was a major World War II campaign, in which the Allies took Sicily from the Axis. It was a large scale amphibious and airborne operation, followed by six weeks of land combat. \nHusky began on the night of July 9 1943, and ended August 17. Strategically, Husky achieved the goals set out for it by Allied planners. The Allies drove Axis air and naval forces from the island, the Mediterranean sea lanes were opened and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was toppled from power. It opened the way to the Allied invasion of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Operation_Dragon_title;Operation Dragoon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Operation_Dragon_desc;Operation Dragoon was the Allied invasion of southern France on August 15 1944, six weeks after D-Day. The invasion was initiated by an amphibious assault by elements of the U.S. Seventh Army, with a follow-up force made up primarily of the French First Army. It was a large and complex military operation with well-executed amphibious and airborne components, and allowed for the seizure of vital ports to supply Allied forces in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Italy_Campaign_title;Allied invasion of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Italy_Campaign_desc;The Allied invasion of Italy, was the Allied landing on mainland Italy on September 3 1943, by General Harold Alexander's 15th Army Group (comprising Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army and Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army) during World War II. The operation followed the successful invasion of Sicily. The main invasion force landed around Salerno on the western coast in Operation Avalanche, while two supporting operations took place in Calabria (Operation Baytown) and Taranto (Operation Slapstick).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zDD_Battle_of_Stalingrad_title;Battle of Stalingrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zDD_Battle_of_Stalingrad_desc;The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad. The battle took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as one of the turning points of the war. \nThe battle was the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million. The battle involved more participants than any other, and was marked by brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive — which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city — was the first substantial German land defeat of World War II. The battle was arguably the most important turning point in not only the Eastern Front, but the War itself, as it marked the beginning of the Soviet counter-offensive that greatly contributed to the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany around two and a half years later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zDD-Defense_Atlantic_title;Atlantikwall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zDD-Defense_Atlantic_desc;Erwin Rommel proposed that the armoured formations be deployed close to the invasion beaches. Von Schweppenburg argued that the Panzer formations should be concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen, and deployed en masse against the main Allied beachhead when this had been identified. \nWhen the matter was brought to Hitler, he gave an unworkable compromise solution, giving three tank divisions to Rommel, and allowing von Schweppenburg to scatter the other tanks across Northern France and the Netherlands. The other mechanized divisions capable of intervening in Normandy were retained under the direct control of the German Armed Forces HQ (OKW) and were initially denied to Rommel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Volkssturm_doctrine_decision_desc;In order for these militia units to be effective, Hitler and Bormann counted not only on strength in numbers, but also in fanaticism. During the early stages of Volkssturm planning, it became apparent that if militia units lacked morale they would lack combat effectiveness. To achieve the envisioned fanaticism, Volkssturm units were placed under direct command of the local Nazi party, meaning local Gau- and Kreisleiters. \nThe new Volkssturm was also to become a nationwide organization, with Heinrich Himmler as Replacement Army Commander, responsible for armament and training.  Though normally under party control, Volkssturm units were placed under Wehrmacht command when engaging in action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

pearl_harbor_decision_title;Operation Z - Attack of Pearl Harbour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pearl_harbor_decision_desc;Aircraft and midget submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy began an attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii.  Contrary to popular belief, these attacks were not a surprise. The Americans had deciphered Japan's code earlier and knew about a planned attack before it actually occurred. However, due to difficulty in deciphering intercepted messages, the Americans failed to discover Japan's target before the attack occurred. \nUnder the command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the attack was devastating in loss of life and damage to the U.S. fleet. At 6:05 a.m. on December 7, the six Japanese carriers launched a first wave of 183 planes composed mainly of dive bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters. The Japanese hit American ships and military installations at 7:51 a.m. The first wave attacked military airfields on Ford Island. At 8:30 a.m. a second wave of 170 Japanese planes, mostly torpedo bombers, attacked the fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
kamikaze_decision_title;'Kamikaze Tactics' Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kamikaze_decision_desc;[This decision activates the 'Kamikaze' tech] Although Kamikaze was the most common and best-known form of Japanese suicide attack during World War II, they were similar to the Banzai charge used by Japanese soldiers. The main difference between the two is that suicide is essential to the success of a Kamikaze attack, whereas a Banzai charge is only potentially suicidal, that is, the attackers hope to survive but do not expect to. The tradition of suicide instead of defeat, capture and perceived shame was deeply entrenched in the Japanese military culture. It was one of the main traditions in the samurai life and the Bushido code: loyalty and honour until death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

lend_lease_decision_desc;Lend-Lease was the name of the program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations with vast amounts of war material between 1941 and 1945. It began in March 1941, over 18 months after the outbreak of the war in September 1939. It was called An Act Further to Promote the Defense of the United States. This act also ended the pretense of the neutrality of the United States. Hitler recognized this and consequently had his submarines attack US ships such as the SS Robin Moor, a 5,000 ton unarmed merchant steamship destroyed by a German U-boat on 21 May, 1941 outside of the war zone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

An attack on French North Africa was proposed instead, which would clear the Axis Powers from North Africa," improve naval control of the Mediterranean Sea and prepare for an invasion of the "Soft Underbelly" of Southern Europe in 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,

Soviet_Polish_war_title;Soviet Invasion of Poland ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Soviet_Polish_war_desc;Hitler's troops were already wreaking havoc in Poland, having invaded on the first of September 1939. The Polish army began retreating east and regrouping near Lvov, in eastern Galicia, attempting to escape the relentless German land and air offensives. But Polish troops had jumped from the frying pan into the fire, as Soviet troops began occupying eastern Poland. \nThe Ribbentrop-Molotov Non-Aggression Pact, signed in August, had eliminated any hope Poland had of a Russian ally in a war against Germany. Little did Poles know that a secret clause of that pact, the details of which would not become public until 1990," gave the U.S.S.R. the right to mark off for itself a chunk of Poland's eastern region. The "reason" given was that Russia had to come to the aid of its "blood brothers", the Ukrainians and Byelorussians who were trapped in territory that had been illegally annexed by Poland. Now Poland was squeezed from West and East—trapped between two behemoths.\nIts forces overwhelmed by a mechanized modern German army, Poland had nothing left with which to fight the Soviets. As Soviet troops broke into Poland, they unexpectedly met up with German troops who had fought their way that far east in a little more than two weeks. The Germans receded when confronted by the Soviets, handing over their Polish prisoners of war. Thousands of Polish troops were taken into captivity, some Poles simply surrendered to the Soviets to avoid being captured by the Germans. The Soviet Union would wind up with about three-fifths of Poland and 13 million of it's people as a result of the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,

##SPA Plan Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plan_imperial_title;Start Plan Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
plan_imperial_desc;Plan Imperial was an ambitious Spanish shipbuilding plan. It was created in 1936, revised in 1938 but never implemented due to high damage caused by the civil war. But we managed to finish with so-called 'Republicans' fast and without great damage to the country. Now if you wish, Caudilio, we can begin preparations to implement Plan Imperial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

Soviet_rail_construction_title;Change the Soviet Rail Guauge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Soviet_rail_construction_desc;Without a doubt, the German railway transportation system played a far more strategic role on the eastern front than it did in any other German theater of war. With the exception of the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and areas in close proximity to larger Soviet urban or industrial/production centers, the rail and ground transportation network of the Soviet Union was in a more primitive state of existence when compared to western Europe or the United States. German military railroad planners made one critical error in their Barbarossa calculations - they did not take the primitiveness of the Soviet interior into account when planning for their attack. This would cost the Germans dearly later. In the west, the problems encountered were minimal. All of the defeated nations used standard gauge rail lines. With little effort, these new networks were amalgamated into the German system. Only Spain used wide gauge lines, but as long as Spain remained a neutral, this really did not affect the German military situation any. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

Hitlers_standfast_order_desc;The winter of 1941-42 was a hard time for the German Army on the Eastern Front. Momentum ground slowly to a halt as the temperatures dropped. It is not an overestimation to state that after six months of continuous fighting, mounting casualties, dreadful weather and supply lines which were overstretched, the Wehrmacht was close to collapse at the end of November 1941. n 5 December 1941,500,000 Soviet troops launched the Soviet winter offensive. On 8 December, before leaving for Berlin, Hitler, in response to the Red Army offensive, issued a directive to the commander of Army Group Centre," Field Marshal von Bock. While conceding that the severe winter weather and consequent supply difficulties required the troops around Moscow to abandon "all major offensive operations and go over to the defensive", he would sanction no withdrawals unless fortified lines could be prepared close by as rallying points. Given the difficulty of erecting such lines in the frozen and forested terrain, the exposed units at the front entertained few hopes of relief. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

The target today was an important industrial and shipping area with a population of about 258,000.\n    The great bomb, which harnesses the power of the universe to destroy the enemy by concussion, blast and fire, was dropped on the second enemy city about seven hours after the Japanese had received a political "roundhouse punch" in the form of a declaration of war by the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Stage 1 costs 15k supplies, stage 2 20K and stage 3 25K. \nBe aware, that after 30 days the naval base will revert to the level 1. You cannot build this port on province that already has any level of a naval base;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
