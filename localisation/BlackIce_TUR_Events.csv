EVTDESC980001;The province of Dersim had been a difficult one for Turkey to control, dating back to the Ottoman period. The local Kurdish rulers, Aghas, resisted the Kemalist policies of the new Republic of Turkey, which favoured ethnic Turks at the expense of Kurds. The Turkification process of the province began in earnest in 1934, with the resettlement of ethnic Turks and the eviction of Kurdish Alevis, and the renaming of Dersim to Tunceli. Kurdish children were sent to schools out of the region and encouraged to be Turkified through marriage and education. The Aghas resisted these measures along with increased taxation and as the Turkish military began to expand, public sentiment rapidly soured and soon the province was in open rebellion. Turkey deployed tens of thousands of troops to the region and began a campaign of aerial bombardment. Over three campaigns stretching into September 1938, the Turkish military killed anywhere between 13,000 and 70,000 Kurds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
