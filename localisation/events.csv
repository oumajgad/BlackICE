reoccupation_of_the_rhineland_title;Re-occupation of the Rhineland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reoccupation_of_the_rhineland_desc; Once the home front was secured, Hitler turned his attention to foreign policy with four increasingly daring acts.  On the 16th of March 1935, the Treaty of Versailles was violated by Germany as military conscription was reintroduced.  The treaty stated that the German Army should not exceed 100,000 men.\n When nothing more than official protests from England and France followed, Hitler proceeded, a year later on 7 March 1936, to occupy the demilitarised Rhineland, again violating the Versailles Treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anschluss_of_austria_title;Anschluss of Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anschluss_of_austria_desc; Demands for the union (Anschluss) of Austria and Germany increased after Adolf Hitler became German Chancellor.  In February 1938, Hitler invited Kurt von Schuschnigg, the Austrian Chancellor, to meet him at Berchtesgaden.  Hitler demanded concessions for the Austrian Nazi Party.  Schuschnigg refused and on 9th March 1938, the Austrian Chancellor announced a plebiscite (referendum) on the independence of Austria.\n Adolf Hitler took this as an opportunity to take action against the Austrian State.  Schuschnigg was pressed to resign.  The National Socialist Arthur Seyss-Inquart took over the chancellorship and formed a new government.  The Austrian National Socialists took power in Austria.\n  On the morning of 12 March 1938, troops of the German Wehrmacht and the SS crossed the German-Austrian border.  On 13 March 1938, Hitler, in Linz announced the passage of the "Anschluss" (Annexation) of Austria into the German Reich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_treaty_of_munich_title;The Treaty of Munich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_treaty_of_munich_desc; During the summer of 1938 the pro-Nazi elements among the Czech-Germans demanded the right to secede from Czechoslovakia.  A move that created enormous tension between Germany and Czechoslovakia.  Hitler, using the minority sentiments in the Sudetenland started to propagandize about "Czech Atrocities" against ethnic Germans in an effort to lay the blame for a future conflict on the Czech government.  At the same time", as German troops infiltrated the Bohemian borderlands, Hitler agreed to host a Peace Conference in Munich.\nHitler, Chamberlain, Daladier, and Mussolini met and agreed that Hitler should have the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia.  The Czechs, who were not represented at the meeting, realised that their own allies were deserting them and under pressure from the French and British, they were forced to surrender the Sudetenland to Germany.\n Hitler assured those at the meeting that this was the extent of his ambitions for expansion.  Chamberlain returned to England with a piece of paper signed by Hitler proclaiming "peace in our time.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
first_vienna_award_title;The First Vienna Award;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
first_vienna_award_desc; The Vienna Award was a diplomatic attempt by Germany and Italy to enforce Hungary's claims to the southern parts of Carpathian Rus and Slovakia, at that time a part of Czechoslovakia.  Negotiations started in October 1938, but despite intense negotiations, no satisfactory solution acceptable for both parties was to be found.\nIn November, Hungarian forces began to cross the border into the territory and only a few months later, Hitler gave Hungary his permission to annex the remaining lands of Carpathian Rus, thus reestablishing the historic borders between Hungary and Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_first_vienna_award_title;The First Vienna Award;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_first_vienna_award_desc; After the swallowing of the Sudetenland, Hitler used a small group of Slovakian patriots around Tiso more or less forcing them to proclaim an independent Slovakia.  At the same time German troops started to move across the Czechoslovakian border on the pretext of "protecting" the Slovak people. Swiftly demanding the Czech president come to Germany to discuss recent "Czech problems" Hitler managed to isolate and threaten the Czech leader into submission.  A few days later the German Army had full control of the former Czechoslovakia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claims_on_memel_title;Claims on Memel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claims_on_memel_desc; On 22nd March 1939 after immense pressure and with German forces ready to attack, the Lithuanian government agreed to give Memel (Klaipeda) to Germany and to sign a non-aggression pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guarantee_independence_of_poland_title;Guarantee the Independence of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guarantee_independence_of_poland_desc; Ribbentrop asked the Poles for the return of Danzig and a strip of German territory across the Polish corridor on which a German-run road and rail link could be built.  This time Hitler met real resistance.  On 31 March 1939 the British and French guaranteed the borders of Poland.  Encouraged by the guarantee, the Poles were not about to compromise.\n Then, as 1939 progressed, the position of the Soviet Union became critical.  If Stalin allied himself with Britain, Germany would run the risk of a two-front war if she pushed the world toward conflict.  British attempts at negotiation with the Soviet Union were, however, lacklustre.  For both ideological and practical reasons Stalin had purged thousands of officers from the Red Army and the Soviets were perceived to be a third-rate military force.  Stalin was also unwilling to be pushed into a war which offered him little in terms of his own narrow self-interest.\n Then the Nazis pulled what Manfred von Schröder calls a stroke of courage and genius."  They signed their own treaty with the Soviet Union", their greatest ideological enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

molotov_ribbentrop_pact_title;The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
molotov_ribbentrop_pact_desc; On August 23, 1939 Hitler and Stalin signed a non-aggression pact, called the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty.  Secret protocols of the treaty defined the territorial spheres of influence Germany and Russia would have after a successful invasion of Poland.  Hitler had been creating justifications and laying plans for such an invasion since April.  According to the agreement, Russia would have control over Latvia, Estonia, and Finland, while Germany would gain control over Lithuania and Danzig.\n Poland would be partitioned into three major areas.  The Warthland area, bordering Germany would be annexed outright to the German Reich, and all non-German inhabitants expelled to the east. Over 77,000 square miles of eastern Polish lands, with a population of over thirteen million would become Russian territory.  The central area would become a German protectorate, named the General Government, governed by a German civil authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_bessarabia_title;Claim Bessarabia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_bessarabia_desc; On the 27th of June 1940, Romania bowed to a Russian ultimatum demanding the immediate cession not only of Bessarabia but also of the northern part of the Bukovina.  That area had never formally been ceded to Romania and was thus claimed for the USSR’s sphere of influence in the agreement with Hitler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ultimatum_to_the_baltic_states_title;Deliver Ultimatum to the Baltic States;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ultimatum_to_the_baltic_states_desc; During the summer of 1940 the Soviet Union began making preparations for a total takeover of the Baltic States.  According to the non-aggression pact signed by Hitler and Stalin the previous year, the Soviets would get control over Latvia, Estonia and Finland, while Germany would focus on Danzig and Lithuania.  On the 15th of June, an ultimatum was delivered to Lithuania, and just a few days later similar terms were presented to Latvia and Estonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_lend_lease_act_title;The Lend-Lease Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_lend_lease_act_desc; The Lend-Lease Agreements were arrangements for the transfer of war supplies, including food, machinery, and services, to nations whose defence was considered vital to the defence of the United States in World War II.  The Lend-Lease Act, passed in 1941 by the U.S. Congress, gave the President power to sell, transfer, lend or lease such war materials.  The President was directed to set the terms for aid repayment to be "in kind or property" or any other direct or indirect benefit which the President deems satisfactory."\n\nHarry L. Hopkins was appointed in March", 1941 to administer lend-lease.  He was replaced in July by Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., who headed the Office of Lend-Lease Administration, set up in Oct., 1941.  In Sept.,1943, lend-lease was incorporated into the Foreign Economic Administration under Leo T. Crowley.  In Sept.,1945, it was transferred to the Dept. of State.\n Lend-lease was originally intended for China and countries of the British Empire.  In Nov.,1941, the USSR was included, and by the end of the war practically all the allies of the United States had been declared eligible for lend-lease aid.  Although not all requested or received it, lend-lease agreements were signed with numerous countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
us_occupation_of_iceland_greenland_title;Control of Greenland and Iceland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
us_occupation_of_iceland_greenland_desc; After the German occupation of Denmark in April 1940 British forces swiftly took possession of Iceland to counter a possible threat of a German invasion.  Britain held it with few forces and in early 1941 it was evident that it would be better if the United States took over the watch-keeping.  By the summer of 1941, U. S. troops occupied both Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe U. S. occupation of Greenland was arranged through an agreement between the United States government and a rebellious Danish Ambassador in Washington.  This Danish Ambassador refused to recognize or obey the Danish government in Copenhagen after the German occupation of Denmark, which began in April of 1940.  The Greenland Agreement, signed in April of 1941, encountered vigorous protests from both the Danish government and the German Embassy in Washington.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
great_officer_purge_title;Begin the Great Officer Purge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
great_officer_purge_desc; During the 1930's Stalin’s paranoia had increased and numerous power struggles between lesser men were viewed as dangerous to his leadership.  In a wave of three major and a dozen smaller purges the political and military leadership of the Soviet Union was effectively decimated and put under Stalin's strict control.\n The purge of the army eliminated 3 of the 5 marshals, 14 of the 16 army commanders, and approximately half of the 70 to 80,000 men in the entire officer corps.  Needless to say, this purge inevitably had an extremely destructive effect on the effectiveness of the Red Army's military leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industry_moved_to_siberia_v1_title;Transfer Some of the Industry to Siberia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industry_moved_to_siberia_v1_desc; When the onslaught by the Germans began, Soviet army groups in the west were quickly overrun and the remainder of the Red Army had to rapidly devise a plan for defense.  Soviet leadership decided that the Red Army had to slow down the German advance and force their armies to spread out as thinly as possible.  This would make it possible to launch a counter-offensive during the next year.\n It was also decided that this plan would buy the Soviets time to dismantle heavy industry facilities in the west and move them to Siberia in order to maintain production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

annexation_of_albania_title;Annexation of Albania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
annexation_of_albania_desc; Italy delivered Tiranë an ultimatum on March 25,1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania.  King Zog refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania, and on April 7,1939, Mussolini's troops invaded Albania.  Despite some stubborn resistance, especially at Durrës, the Italians made short shrift of the Albanians.\n Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen Geraldine Apponyi, and their infant son, Skander fled to Greece and eventually to London.  On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to unite the country with Italy.  Victor Emmanuel III took the Albanian crown, and the Italians set up a fascist government under Shefqet Verlaci and soon absorbed Albania's military and diplomatic services into Italy's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

finnish_winter_war_title;The Finnish Winter War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
finnish_winter_war_desc;The non-aggression pact between Germany and Russia in August 1939 turned many heads in Finland.  Germany agreed to give the Baltic States, including Finland, to Russia.  Of course, all this was kept a secret, but as time went on, the events became known to the Finns.\n As Russian aggression grew, the Finns requested help from Germany, only to be turned away - leaving the Finns to face Russia's aggression alone.  When Finland refused to allow the Soviet Union to build military bases on its territory, the latter revoked the nonaggression pact of 1932 and attacked Finland on 30 November 1939.\n The Winter War ended in a peace treaty drawn up in Moscow on the 13th of March,1940, giving south-eastern Finland to the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Ecuador was unprepared to meet the Peruvian invasion.  The Ecuadorian president's fear of being left unprotected from his political opponents led him to keep the nation's best fighting forces in Quito.\n When the much larger Peruvian army moved quickly into the southern coastal province of El Oro, the fewer than 1,800 Ecuadorian troops in the area lacked sufficient air cover, and were able to offer only limited resistance.  Peruvian forces also moved into the disputed Amazonian territory without significant opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Commonwealth remained linked through common allegiance to the Crown. King George V was succeeded by his son, Edward VIII.;König George V des vereinigten Königreiches starb am 20. Januar 1936. Er war sowohl an der politischen als auch an der sozialökonomischen Front aktiv. Der freie irische Staat wurde 1922 unter seiner Herrschaft errichtet und er nahm eine vermittelnde Rolle im Generalstreik von 1926 ein. Das vielleicht bemerkenswerteste Gesetz, das unter seiner Herrschaft verabschiedet wurde, war das Statut von Westminster (1931), das es den Parlamenten der Dominions ermöglichte, ihre eigenen Gesetze ohne Zustimmung aus London zu verabschieden. Durch die gemeinsame Treue zur Krone blieb das Commonwealth jedoch weiterhin verbunden. König George V gab den Thron an seinen Sohn, Edward VIII. weiter.;;George V, Rey del Reino Unido falleció el 20 de Enero de 1936.

Quizás la ley más notable de cuantas aprobó durante su reinado fue el Estatuto de Westmister (1931), que permitió que los parlamentos de los Dominios pudieran aprobar sus propias leyes sin necesidad de ser aprobados por el Rey en Londres. La Commonwealth continuó unida por la común lealtad a la Corona Británica. George V fue sucedido por su hijo, Edward VIII.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC2701;Japan is offering us a deal while holding a knife to our throat.  They want us to join the Axis, thereby giving us a chance to reclaim the territories we lost to Britain in 1909.

EVTDESC5001;Last week we had the displeasure of disclosing certain suspect activities relating to a prominent figure in the Government.  This week the minister concerned failed to make a public speech denying his involvement in the scandal.  However, an expert reporter of one of the national radio stations managed to press the minister into more or less confessing that he has not only lied to the public about his involvement, but also that he has been lying to the High Court on several occasions.

EVTNAME5012;Clashes Between Paramilitary troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5012;High unemployment and political dissent have left our country in a very fractious state.  Several political parties have decided to establish paramilitary forces to protect their party's interests and convince voters to give them their support.  As a consequence, politically motivated assassinations and conflicts between left- and right-wing troops have become a daily occurrence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5012;Do something about it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5012;What for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5013;Re-organization of the War Ministry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5013;The administration of the war ministry has been quite dissatisfactory lately, to say the least.  Unfortunately, this view isn't shared by all members of the government.  On the bright side, one of your highest ranking officers has offered to arrange a minor scandal, just to give a reorganization of the ministry some legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5013;We need more ministers like him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5013;That's just ridiculous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5014;Strike Against Forced Conscription Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5014;The idea of a forced conscription policy does not seem to sit well with some of our citizens.  A few smaller groups have already organized a general strike and it seems to gain new followers at a worrying speed.  It might be best to round up the strike leaders as soon as possible to prevent any further escalation of protests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5014;Give it the highest priority;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5014;It's nothing to worry about;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5015;Control Extremist Political Movements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5015;It is clear that we need to take harder measures to control political extremist movements.  A suggestion has been put forward for a law that would ban political marches without governmental consent, and prohibit the organization and training of groups with the aim of usurping the functions of the police or armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5015;Give your consent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5015;That's taking it too far;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5016;Emergency Legislation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5016;There have been intense discussions the past couple of days regarding the introduction of emergency legislation.  War seems all but inevitable at this stage, but by introducing new defence regulations, the government would be able to prosecute such a war much more effectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB5016;Find some other solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5017;Anti-Terrorist Measures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5017;Last night a fire broke out in the parliamentary headquarters.  The incident has been labeled arson, and it has been established that political motives were behind the act.  To prevent such acts from occurring in the future a decree has been put forward to protect our people and state against such terrorist acts in the future, by increasing the government's power and imposing further restrictions on civil liberties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5017;It's about time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5018;Prohibit the Establishment of New Parties;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5018;There has been an ongoing discussion in our government for some time now in regards to whether new organizations, such as trade unions and political parties, should be allowed to form or not.  Several of our ministers are of the opinion that it poses too much of a threat to our current government, and that it would be better instead to impose certain restrictions and increase control of those aspects of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5018;...and not a day too early;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5018;It seems a bit extreme;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5019;Political Feuds within the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5019;Two of our ministers seem unable to come to an agreement in regards to who's in control of the propaganda press.  A few days ago their petty issues even led to armed conflict between the supporters of the respective ministers.  It would seem wise to intervene and stop this nonsense, since they obviously seem unable to solve the issue on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5019;Ridiculous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5020;Assassination Attempt of Minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5020;One of our ministers was the target of an assassination attempt a few hours ago.  It's still unclear who was behind the attack, but suspicions have been raised towards a member of the Communist Party.

EVTOPTA5021;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5022;Illegal Printing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5022;We have just received reports from the secret police, that a printing press has been found in a warehouse, just outside the city. Several documents and pamphlets, criticizing the policies of our government were also discovered, leading the police to conclude that the warehouse has been used as some kind of hub for meetings and the distribution of political material.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5022;Increase efforts to track them down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5022;There are more pressing matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5023;Intelligence Network;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5023;The matter of intelligence agencies has been discussed intensely during the week.  Most members of our government are of the opinion that the scope and power of our existing agencies should be vastly increased.  It has also been proposed that we put considerable focus on the establishment of new networks in most of the major countries, to ensure that they view us as favourably as they ought to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5023;Of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5023;That won't be necessary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5024;Minister Cooperating with Revolutionary Movements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5024;We have just been informed that one our ministers might be one of the key conspirators in a planned coup d'état.  According to witnesses, the minister has spent the last few months sending secret instructions to various military units that were to partake in the uprising.  We have no information of his exact whereabouts at the moment, but according to the same witnesses, it shouldn't be too hard to track him down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5024;Find him, whatever it takes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5024;It's no use;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5025;Strike Against Forced Conscription Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5025;The decision to incorporate the youth from certain occupied territories into our armed forces has met with fierce resistance in some areas.  A resistance movement has already been organized in one of the larger cities and according to recent reports, it has grown considerably the last couple of days.  If this is allowed to continue, it won't take long before the whole administration comes to a standstill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5025;Give it the highest priority;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5025;Send some troops to deal with it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5026;Resistance Movement Infiltrated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5026;One of our intelligence agencies has just informed us that a member of their's has managed to infiltrate one of the larger resistance movements.  They want to know how you want them to proceed.  It might be better to wait for a while, and let the insider gather some more information before we bring them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5026;There's no point in waiting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5026;We'll wait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5027;Re-organization of the Foreign Ministry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5027;The head of the Foreign Ministry is of the firm belief that the ministry is in need of some restructuring.  In his opinion, some of the senior diplomats are too hesitant towards change, and therefore not up to par with our country's current demands.  He is convinced that replacing some of the more troublesome ministers would improve the situation considerably.  He has already composed a list of possible candidates, loyal men that are known to favour more aggressive policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5027;Good initiative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5027;There's no need;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5028;Retaliation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5028;The house of our Minister of Intelligence was set on fire late last night.  It is believed that the attack was in retaliation for our purported attack on the leader of the opposition party a short while back.  It is very likely that the group responsible for the act, belongs to a small extremist group of the party, and did not act on the orders of the party as a whole.  Fortunately nobody was injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5028;We have to put an end to this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5029;Corruption Within the Police Force;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5029;We have long suspected that the main interest of certain members of our police force no longer lies in just protecting our citizens and state, but rather in empowering themselves within the local community.  Some internal restructuring might be needed to weaken these individuals and restore the overall efficiency of the force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5029;That seems a bit overly ambitious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5029;Do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5030;Unauthorized Demonstration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5030;Reports have just reached us that an unauthorized demonstration in the city centre has developed into a full fledged riot.  Several shops and local businesses have been completely plundered or severely damaged.  The local police have been unable to restore order and are in desperate need of reinforcements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5030;Send reinforcements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5030;They can handle it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5031;Resistance Leader Tries to Flee the Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5031;We have just been informed that the leader of one of the major resistance movements attempted to flee the country last night.  Luckily, he was apprehended close to the border, as one of his men betrayed him before he had a chance to cross.  There are some speculations that an attack was planned as soon as he was safe, but so far he hasn't revealed anything.  His interrogation will continue and we should take extra precaution the next couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5031;Of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5032;Assassination Attempt of Opposition Leader;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5032;The leader of the largest opposition party was the target of an assassination attempt late last night.  Naturally, suspicions have been raised towards our party members, and as a consequence riots have erupted on the streets between our followers and groups supporting the opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5032;Do what you can to calm things down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5032;Let the army handle it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5033;Weapons found amongst rail freight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5033;Our secret police force made a major find this morning.  A large amount of weapons was found on one of the trains leaving the capitol early this morning.  The train was heading towards a minor city just a few miles from here, alledged to be the main camp for a small resistance group.  Perhaps it's about time we paid them a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5033;Send some troops to investigate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5033;Don't bother. It's just a minor group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5034;Bribed Minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5034;A member of our government has been accused of cooperating with the opposition party.  According to the source, the minister in question has accepted bribes, more than once, to make sure certain proposals are rejected.  Naturally, the minister himself denies any involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5034;Defend him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5034;Give him a new position;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5035;Rigged Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5035;The largest opposition party made a public speech earlier today, accusing us of intimidating voters and trying to rig elections in our favour.  We have to convince people somehow, that there's no truth to these accusations, and that the right party is in fact ruling this country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5035;Prepare a speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5036;Leak Within the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5036;We have reasons to believe that someone within the government has been leaking sensitive information.  There have been too many situations lately where our enemies have seemed to be a little bit too prepared to just be a coincidence.  A preliminary investigation is already under way, but so far nothing has been found that could prove anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA5036;It's probably nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB5036;Increase your efforts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME5037;Foreign Nation Supports Opposition Party;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5037;Our intelligence agency has just informed us that they suspect that some foreign country is supporting one of the opposition parties financially.  It would certainly explain that party's sudden increase of resources.  Depending on the amount of support they actually receive, this could pose some real problems for us in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Pétain and his ministers thought that France, as a colonial power and a major influence on Europe between the wars, would be well placed to become an important ally to this powerful nation in the heart of a new European order "un nouveau ordre européen."  A strong government - "L'État français", the French State, was created on 12 July 1940 - and some form of cooperation with Germany would be a necessary precondition for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

USN focused on Special Treatment Steel which was good as both armour and structural steel."Only" downside was the cost of that steel which was the reason why only USA used it on all its ships build after 1930. Royal Navy and Kriegsmarine used Krupp Cemented Steel which was probably best armour steel available at the time, but limited its usage to capital ships and carriers. *AI JAP, GER, USA, ENG will follow historical path here.

EVTDESC530013;Our enemies caused us more problems than our staff predicted. Our units were defeated by combination of enemy tactical and strategical superiority, detailed planning and incredibly effective artillery support. All those caused our brightest generals to rethink their way of handling battles. It was requested to use gathered information and experience and incorporate "borrowed" ideas into our doctrine. On the other hand other generals, believe that we should stick to our, in their opinion, still superior doctrine and ignore different approaches to warfare. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Starting with small arms, mortars and ending on heavy artillery, mechanized troops and tanks. What's worse our enemy wasn't mindlessly sending more and more guns at us. It was well organized battle with all troops knowing when to attack, counterattack or defend. They had firepower advantage and they knew how to use it as best as possible.

Something that for frontline soldiers looked like neverending, mindless hordes of infantry and tanks was in fact decently planned and executed operation combining all available troop types. And not only on tiny part of the front, but in multiple places. Something that we thought was accidental, is in fact effective strategy with pre-planned points of concentrated attacks supported by tremendous ammounts of artillery, mobile troops and planes. This and sheer numbers of enemy forces simply overpowered our troops. We have a chance now to fix issues with our own army and tactics by learning from our enemies.

Aikawa is certain this investment will bring Manchukuo's resource production to new heights and has promised an expansion of the Showa Steel Works production soon after his proposal is approved. We can choose to give this new entity financial help, industrial help or both for an even stronger result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9300214;Following the creation of the Mangyo(Manchurian Industrial Development Company) and as promised by Aikawa, the Showa Steel Works has been greatly expanded and is now on course to become one of the largest iron and steel centers of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9300215;Mangyo(Manchurian Industrial Development Company) has since it's creation been doing everything to improve the efficiency of our steel mills in Machuria. With warmer relations between Germany and Japan, Mangyo decided to license the Krupp-Renn process from German steel markers and send people to Germany for training in this method. With the training process complete, Krupp has sent the equipment which promises to greatly increase the steel production of the Showa Steel Works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9300216;One of Japan's first key investments in Manchuria was the creation of the Manchukuo National Railway and it's expansion. Merging existing railway companies, finishing existing construction plans and connecting detached lines has been a long process, occupying most of the companies existence. We are now in the final stage of this process and starting to collect the results of our investments in a significant increase in Manchukuo's resource output. However there are still some minor connections to complete and the large disparity between the gauge of our new connections and the North Manchuria Railway Bureau built by the Soviets to fix. We must now choose to complete this final investment or settle for what we have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9300217;While most of Manchuria is already well connected by rail, the southeast near northeast Korea remains a hole in our rail network, separating Korean railways from the Manchukuo National Railway. This doesn't let us take full advantage of some of the coal deposits in the region and poses a logistical problem if war with Soviet Union breaks out. The Kwantung Army has been pushing for the idea of creating the East Manchuria Railway here and the time has come for us to make a decision on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9300218;The Nagoya Pan-Pacific Peace Exposition is to be held during the next couple of months, it's intended to promote industry, transportation, education, science, construction, architecture, social welfare, tourism, fine arts and crafts. Most countries in the Pacific will be participating and it's an important oportunity to bolster our foreign relations. While prince Higashikuni Naruhiko intends for this exposition to showcase the Nagoya region as an industrial and cultural center of the empire, many members of the IJA object to the idea of a completely peaceful exposition. We can either stay true to the name of the event and improve our foreign relations or give the IJA a hall for a display of force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9300219;The Yagi-Uda antenna was invented in 1926 by Shintaro Uda and Hidetsugu Yagi of the Tohoku Imperial University. Its concept has attracted a lot of interest due to its simplicity and directionality, some aviation engineers in our armed forces even think it could be used as an individual radar for aircraft in the future. Unfortunately, the IJA and the IJN are less than convinced and they oppose any sort of interference forcing them to make use of this invention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9300220;In a recent operation our troops have captured a team of enemy Radar Technicians with notes on something called the "yagi antenna". Embarassingly, our own intelligence officers didn't recognize it at first but this is the invention of a Japanese professor from 1926. This antenna is used by enemy aircraft for radar search and has been giving the enemy an edge in our engagements, it's about time we use our own technology...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC88695;On the 11th of March 1936, an army of less than 100 Mongolian soldiers with six Soviet advisors invaded the disputed village of Tauran, where they defeated the Manchurian defenders. Later that same day the Imperial Japanese Army with some Manchurian volunteers launched an attack to retake the village. The Japanese forces consisted of ten armored vehicles and dozens of warplanes, which bombed the village overnight. The next morning the Japanese launched their ground assault with a force of more than 400 soldiers and a few tanks. The Mongolians were slaughtered and barely did any damage to the Japanese as they were forced to retreat. A quarter of their initial force was killed along with two officers and their commander. Three Soviet advisors were also killed, creating tensions between both nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88696;On the 19th of June 1937 three Soviet gunboats (Type 1124 BKA "armoured cutters") crossed the center line of the Amur river, unloaded twenty troops and occupied Kanchazu Island. On June 20, 17 Manchurian police and soldiers were sent to investigate the border intrusion. On the morning of June 30, IJA soldiers from the 49th Regiment of the 1st Division led by Colonel Mihara Kanae launched a prolonged attack against the Soviets. Sheeling from Japanese forces sank the Soviet lead gunboat and damaged the other two leading to the Soviet evacuation of the Kanchazu island. Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, met with Commissar of Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov on June 29 to discuss the turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9300221;With the stabilization of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War, the Imperial General Headquarters now needs to begin planning the next expansion target. For decades the IJA and the IJN have defended opposing doctrines to solve Japan's resource problems.\n\nThe IJA defends Hokushin-ron, Northern Expansion Doctrine, an attack on the Soviet Union to take hold of the natural resources of Siberia. While the success of the Russo-Japanese War is still fresh in the mind so are the failures of the recent border disputes with the Soviet Union.\n\nThe IJN defends Nanshin-ron, Southern Expansion Doctrine, an attack on the resource rich areas of Southeast Asia. While the riches of the East Indies are considerably more valuable and less defended than the Soviet Union, any movement in the Pacific is sure to raise the attention of the United States of America. While we may start a potential conflict better prepared it is unclear how long the advantage can be mantained due to the industrial difference between us and the USA. With this in mind, some in the Navy General Staff have been circulating the idea of a surprise strike on the US Pacific fleet in order to bring more time for the IJN to fulfill its goals. If we instead choose to attack the Allies alone early it is clear the United States will intevene within a few months and we will lose any opportunity for a surprise attack on them...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9300222;Genrikh Lyushkov, a member of the NKVD has entered into contact with authorities in Manchukuo with the intention to defect. He has promissed to bring with him valuable documents about Soviet military strength in the region which are sure to help us in a potential conflict with them in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9300223;The 2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme is underway and the construction of the Soryu and Hiryu aircraft carriers is coming together. The Tone-class heavy cruisers, Tone and Chikuma, are also under construction and should be complete on schedule. Along with them, the submarine support ship Takasaki is under conversion into the Zuiho light aircraft carrier. In addition to this, several destroyers and torpedo boats are under construction as well as a few long range submarines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC48301;With the break out of war with Japan it is clear that one of their primary goals is to take control of oil rich East Indies. Most of our military advisors think we won't be able to defend them against the Japanese invasion and are suggesting to damage oil facilities in the region as much as we can before they fall into the hands of the enemy. This process will take up to two weeks to complete, we must hold what we can until then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC48302;We managed to destroy some oil facilities in the East Indies in time before the Japanese took hold of them, any province that we still hold will suffer this effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC20010;Since the break out of the Second Sino-Japanese War, public opinion in Australia opposed trade relations with Japan. This culminated in the Dalfram dispute during which, in several instances, wharf labourers refused to load iron destined to Japan.

EVTDESC61000;In BlackICE, unit training level has a permanent effect on the unit performance.\nUnits trained with basic training law will always perform as such, even if the law is changed. To increase their training level they have to be properly retrained with the new training law in place. \nCombat Experience is properly distinguished from training level and can only be obtained through combat. The training level impacts the unit's stats while combat experience has a direct impact on combat as a modifier. The effect of each level of training laws can be seen in the Training folder of the Technology screen. Combinations of training and conscription laws also trigger certain effects which can be checked in Triggered Modifiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC61001;In BlackICE, ministers don't only give flat effects, but they are now also responsible for your country's civilian and war economy. Depending on your choice of ministers for each position you will gain different types of buildings from time to time which are not normally buildable. The selected national focus that year will also impact how often the bonus is gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC61002;Due to game engine limitations, event spawned units are spawned directly on the map instead of in the production queue. Your country will suffer an IC penalty which is scaled with your base IC and on par (generally a little lower) with the IC cost of the unit.\nSometimes alot of units become available at the same time. Taking all of them at the same time could cripple your economy, so consider waiting a bit if you are already low on IC.\n\nAs a reminder: Units that will be removed by events will have coloured names.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC61003;In BlackICE, regular transport ships can not be used to launch naval invasions. This can only be achieved by auxilliary vessels or landing/assault ships.\nLanding/assault ships can be researched, while auxilliary vessels can be requisitioned once a year when at war. These ships represent a wide variety of civilian ships, from fishing boats to merchant ships, as such they are much more fragile and slower than military vessels. The AI is allowed to perform naval invasions with regular transport ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC61004;In BlackICE, provinces hold many new types of buildings with economic, political and combat impact: \n- Coastal Fort/Beach Defenses - Defense against naval invasions \n- Pill Box/Fortress - Defense against land combat \n- Heavy Industry - Increases province Industry by 25% per level(Province with 8 Industry and 4 Heavy Industry gives 16 Industry in total) \n- Steel Refinery - Increases province metal production \n- Coalfield - Increases province energy production \n- Rares Extraction - Increases province rare materials producion \n- Oil Rig - Increases province oil extraction \n- Petroleum Refinery - Increases Oil to Fuel conversion ratio (amount of Oil converted to Fuel every day is half of Total IC) \n- Manufacturing Plant - Increases global supply production \n- Training Base - Increases officer recruitment \n- Research Center - Increases Research Efficiency \n- Base Hospital - Increases Casualty Trickleback \n- Police Center - Decreases revol risk in the province \n- Rail Terminous - Increases global supply throughput \n- Shipyards and Factories - Reduce building cost and time of various units (check Industry tab in Technology screen for current effect). Factories/Shipyards in non-core provinces don't give any bonus. \n- Desperate Defense - Provinces which will strongly resist in combat \n- Weather Impact - Different weather makes provinces more defendable. Weather changes with season, during war time, event indicate the change of weather in different parts of the world;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC61005;In BlackICE, Combined Arms plays a very crucial role in combat, as it did in real life. As such, divisions in BlackICE are typically structured centered around a main brigade type and other support brigades which complement it in various aspects and provide it with opportunities in Combined Arms warfare. Most support brigades represent combatant brigades which enhance the division's stats, ranging from simple artillery to assault guns to armored engineers. Along with combatant brigades, transport and headquarters brigades also play a key role in division structure. Headquarters are required for the division to make use of Combined Arms. Transport brigades provide a unique type of Transport Combined Arms and impact the Division's softness and terrain modifiers. Mixed support brigades, in regular, motorized or armored form, provide an unique type of Combined Arms and enhance the division's stats. The elements of mixed support brigades can be chosen through a series of events which are triggered uppon relevant technological unlocks, the impact of each choice can be seen in the Special tab of the Technology screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC61007;In BlackICE, energy to oil conversion(Coal Liquefaction) is disabled by default, in real life this process was very complicated and not readily available at the industrial scale. However, when at war, energy to oil can be activated through Autarky events. Additionally, nations which had invested heavily into these technologies, such as Germany, will have access to it through certain events before war breaks out. The conversion ratio can be improved as usual through a technology in the Industry tab, after the process is activated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC61008;In BlackICE, a new type of minister, the Science Minister, provides countries with specific boosts to their research based on their speciality. Theoretical Scientists provide no direct benefits but will eventually build Research Centers, Research Specialists provide direct bonus to research but do not build new Research Centers, Technical Specialists provide bonus do available leadership instead of directly to research. The remaining types are specialists in specific areas and will passively produce technological progress in their area. Specialist Science Ministers will also ask for a potential increase in budget through an event which allows them to progress in their speciality faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
