# Website Unit Descriptions ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infantry_brigade_website_desc;This is the traditional, and baseline, Infantry unit.\n\nInfantry is the branch of an army that fights on foot - Soldiers specifically trained to engage, fight, and defeat the enemy in face-to-face combat, and thus bear the brunt of warfare, and suffer the greatest number of casualties. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the backbone of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is more physically stressful and psychologically demanding than that of any other branch of the combat arms, or of the army, emphasizing teamwork in the deployment of spontaneous, sustained aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
airborne_artillery_brigade_website_desc;Airborne guns are airborne artillery pieces, designed for use by paratroopers. They are generally specific or specialised types of infantry support guns, being in the traditional sense capable of being broken down into smaller loads (for transport by aircraft and soldiers).\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> These units are terrific when combined with main-line special forces units such as paratroopers or airlanding infantry! However, go for other forms of artillery for your non-airborne forces.</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
air_cavalry_brigade_website_desc;Air mobility has been a key concept in offensive operations since the 1930s. Initial approaches to air mobility focused on airborne and glider-borne troops. During World War II many assaults were done by military gliders. Following the war faster aircraft led to the abandonment of the flimsy wooden gliders with the then new helicopters taking their place. Four YR-4B helicopters saw limited service in the China Burma India theatre with the 1st Air Commando Group.\n\nAir assault and air mobility are related concepts. However, air assault is distinctly a combat insertion rather than transportation to an area in the vicinity of combat. Air assault operations are not merely movements of soldiers, weapons, and materiel by Army aviation units and must not be construed as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
air_commando_brigade_website_desc;This is a special commando unit which uses the rocket/kamikaze game mechanics. The unit is removed after its mission, however it has the ability to do a fari amount of damage in its attack. It can take badly damage a port, airfield, AA, factory or infra. Unfortunately forts and Pillboxes cannot be damaged in this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
air_hq_brigade_website_desc;Like all headquarter units, the Air Headquarters plans, directs, controls, and coordinates the operations of subordinate air combat assets, and can manage a mix of fighter, bomber, and support aircraft. It provides command, control, staff planning, and supervision of subordinate units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
airlanding_infantry_brigade_website_desc;Much like their sister unit, the paratroopers, air landing troops are capable of parachuting into hostile territory, straight to the action. They can also hitch a ride in gliders.\n\nMissions of air landing troops include seizing and holding, or otherwise exploiting, important tactical localities or installations, in conjunction with or pending the arrival of other military or naval forces. Such missions include seizure and clearance of landing fields, beachheads, strong points, and ports; seizure of essential observation or other critical terrain; severing hostile lines of communication and supply; the destruction of bridges, locks, public utility enterprises, and other designated demolitions; seizure of river crossings, defiles, and other bottlenecks; blocking a hostile counterattack; interrupting the movements of hostile reserves; cooperating in the pursuit or breakthrough by ground forces by operating against enemy reserves and lines of communication, and blocking hostile avenues of retreat - and preventing the enemy from destroying essential installations, supplies, and matériel which might be of use in subsequent operations. It also may includes executing an envelopment from the air in conjunction with an attack by ground forces, execution of surprise attacks as a diversion or feint in connection with other air landing or ground operations, or to create confusion and disorder among the hostile military and civilian personnel. Air landing can also provide an attack against an isolated enemy position, impossible or impracticable of attack by ground forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

amph_armour_brigade_website_desc;Among tracked armored vehicles with amphibious capabilities include those that are intended for use in amphibious assault. The United States started developing a long line of LVT (Landing Vehicle Tracked) designs from ca. 1940.\n\nMany tracked armored vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use, such as armoured fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers nevertheless also have amphibious ability, tactically useful inland, reducing dependence on destroyable and easily-targeted bridges. To provide motive power, they use their tracks, sometimes with added propeller or water jets. As long as the opposite bank has a shallow enough slope for the vehicle to climb out within a few miles, they can cross rivers and water obstacles.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> As a battalion-sized element, these won't make good front-line units. Instead, combine them with your Naval Infantry or Marine division to add a little extra firepower for amphibious assaults!</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anti_air_brigade_website_desc;These are artillery pieces fired from the ground in defense against aerial attack. They were first used in combat in World War I, when field artillery were converted to antiaircraft use by mountings that enabled them to fire nearly vertically. Range finders and searchlights, developed in the 1920s and '30s, increased their effectiveness. Advances in World War II included rapid-firing and automatic weapons, radar for target tracking, and radio-operated fuses.\n\nBritish and U.S. forces used a 40-mm gun that fired ammunition to a height of 2 mi (3.2 km). Heavier guns, up to 120 mm, were used against high-flying bombers. For most of the war, the most effective was the German 88-mm Fliegerabwehrkanone. Its abbreviated name, "flak", became a universal term for antiaircraft fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anti_air_cruiser_website_desc;The anti-air cruiser is a cruiser-class warship that has been converted for anti-aircraft warfare. The development of the anti-aircraft cruiser began in 1935 when the Royal Navy re-armed HMS Coventry and HMS Curlew. Torpedo tubes and 6-inch (15 cm) low-angle guns were removed from these World War I light cruisers and replaced by ten 4-inch (10 cm) high-angle guns with appropriate fire-control equipment to provide larger warships with protection against high-altitude bombers.\n\nA tactical shortcoming was recognized after completing six additional conversions of C-class cruisers. Having sacrificed anti-ship weapons for anti-aircraft armament, the converted anti-aircraft cruisers might need protection themselves against surface units. New construction was undertaken to create cruisers of similar speed and displacement with dual-purpose guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anti_tank_brigade_website_desc;Anti-tank warfare arose as a result of the need to develop technology and tactics to destroy tanks during the First World War. Because tanks represent an enemy's greatest force projection (aside from nuclear artillery and tanks vs. tank engagements), anti-tank warfare has been incorporated into the doctrine of nearly every combat service since.\n\nAnti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. In order to penetrate vehicle armor they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are howitzers. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory ballistics provide terminal kinetic energy to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armor_brigade_website_desc;A tank is a tracked, armoured fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat which combines operational mobility and tactical offensive and defensive capabilities. Firepower is normally provided by a large-calibre main gun in a rotating turret and secondary machine guns, while heavy armour and all-terrain mobility provide protection for the tank and its crew, allowing it to perform all primary tasks required of armoured troops on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armored_car_brigade_website_desc;A military armored car is a type of armored fighting vehicle having wheels (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of tracks, and usually light armor. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result they are not intended for heavy fighting. Their normal use is for reconnaissance, command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> Fast moving and a bonus in most terrain types, armored cars are perfect for adding speed and movement bonuses to mobile and armored divisions!</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armored_support_brigade_website_desc;This unit is an adhoc combination of various armor support units such as Armoured AA, Armoured Engineers and Recon/ light tank units. It can be used as the base for a small combined arms division or combined with armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armored_train_website_desc;The armored train moves via strategic deployment- ie via rail. It is useful as a protection unit for political leaders and has strong AA and suppression abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armor_hq_brigade_website_desc;Like all headquarter units, the Armored Headquarters plans, directs, controls, and coordinates the operations of subordinate combat units, and can employ a mix of combat and combat support brigades itself. It provides command, control, staff planning, and supervision of subordinate units, and establishes a Rear Command Post, Main Command Post, and a Forward Tactical Command Post.\n\nArmored Headquarter units have several advantages over traditional HQ units. In addition to significant increases in direct combat capabilities, they excel at leading armored subordinate units such as tanks, armored cars, and armored engineers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
armored_engineers_brigade_website_desc;Typically based on the platform of a main battle tank, these vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the US the term "combat engineer vehicle (CEV)" is used, in the UK the term "Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)" is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term "armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)" is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes or lifting booms.\n\nThese vehicles are designed to directly conduct obstacle breaching operations and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. It should be noted that while the term "armoured engineer vehicle" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mechanized_infantry_bat_website_desc;Bascially a small, cheaper version of the Mechanized Brigade, this unit fufils the same role as Mechanized Infantry. It can help to keep the cost of Armoured or mechanized formations down and provide extra CA bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_brigade_website_desc;The Field Artillery is one of the Army's combat arms, traditionally one of the three major branches (with Infantry and Armor). It refers to those units that use artillery weapons systems to deliver surface-to-surface long range indirect fire. Indirect fire means that the projectile does not follow the line of sight to the target. Mortars are not field artillery weapons - they are organic to infantry units and are manned by infantry personnel.\n\nField artillery is called the "King of Battle". Conflicts in the 20th century saw artillery become exponentially more effective as indirect fire methods were introduced immediately prior to World War I. During World War I and World War II, field artillery was the single highest casualty-producing weapons system on any battlefield.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> No division is complete without some form of artillery support, and this unit makes a great complement in those pre- and early-war infantry divisions.</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assault_gun_brigade_website_desc;An assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armored chassis, designed for use in the direct fire role in support of infantry when attacking other infantry or fortified positions. The term is a literal translation of the German word "Sturmgeschütz". Germany introduced the first purpose-built assault gun, the StuG III, in the late 1930s thus establishing this category of armoured vehicles.\n\nHistorically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a gun turret limited these weapons field of fire, but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armor to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assault_ship_website_desc;The assault ship is the big brother of the smaller "landing craft". Embodied best by the LSTs (Landing Ship, Tank) vessels used by the U.S. Navy in WW2, they are designed to support amphibious operations by carrying significant quantities of vehicles, cargo, and landing troops directly onto an unimproved shore.\n\nThe first tank landing ships were built to British requirements by converting existing ships. This was followed by the development of a purpose built ship. Thereafter, the British and US collaborated upon a joint design with the majority of the construction carried out by the US and supplied under lend-lease. The majority, a thousand, were laid down in the United States during World War II for use by the Allies. Eighty more were built in the United Kingdom and Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Aux_vessel_website_desc;An auxiliary ship is a naval ship which is designed to operate in any number of roles supporting combatant ships and other naval operations. Auxiliaries are not primary combatants, although they may have some limited combat capacity, usually of a self-defense nature.\n\nAuxiliaries are extremely important for navies of all sizes, as without them, the primary fleet vessels can not be effective. Thus, nearly every navy maintains an extensive fleet of auxiliaries. However, the composition and size of these auxiliary fleets varies depending on the nature of each navy and its primary mission. Smaller coastal navies tend to have smaller auxiliary vessels focusing primarily on littoral and training support roles. Larger blue water navies tend to have large auxiliary fleets comprising longer-range fleet support vessels designed to provide support far beyond territorial waters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
battle_commander_brigade_website_desc;The Battle Commander represents a famous or extremely capable commander and his support staff. The unit is best used as a force multipler in a division on the frontlines. The terrain bonuses can be very useful when added to a powerful division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
battlecruiser_website_desc;A battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a large capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size and cost to a battleship, and typically carried the same kind of heavy guns, but battlecruisers generally carried less armour and were faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
battleship_website_desc;A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of heavy caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation which desired to maintain command of the sea. During World War II, aircraft carriers overtook battleships in power. Some battleships remained in service during the Cold War and the last were decommissioned in the 1990s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mountain_infantry_hq_brigade_website_desc;Like all headquarter units, the Mountain Headquarters plans, directs, controls, and coordinates the operations of subordinate combat units, and can employ a mix of combat and combat support brigades itself. It provides command, control, staff planning, and supervision of subordinate units, and establishes a Rear Command Post, Main Command Post, and a Forward Tactical Command Post.\n\nMountain Headquarter units have several advantages over traditional HQ units. In addition to significant increases in direct combat capabilities, they excel at leading operations in rugged mountainous terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
bergsjaeger_brigade_website_desc;Mountain warfare refers to warfare in the mountains or similarly rough terrain. This type of warfare is also called Alpine warfare, after the Alps mountains. Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of combat as it involves surviving not only combat with the enemy but also the extreme weather and dangerous terrain.\n\nMountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a natural border, and may also be the origin of a water source. Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain requires a special skill set, and often a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than would be needed on level ground. Mountains at any time of year are dangerous: lightning, strong gusts of wind, falling rocks, extreme cold, and crevasses are all additional threats to combatants. Movement, reinforcements, and medical evacuation up and down steep slopes and areas where even pack animals cannot reach involves an enormous exertion of energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cag_website_desc;A Carrier Air Group (CAG) is an operational naval aviation organization composed of several aircraft squadrons and detachments of various types of fixed wing aircraft. Organized, equipped and trained to conduct carrier air operations while embarked aboard aircraft carriers, the various squadrons in a CAG have different, complementary (and sometimes overlapping) missions\n\nThe first Carrier Air Groups were activated in 1937. Initially, the commander of the air group (known as the "CAG") was the most senior commanding officer of the embarked squadrons and was expected to personally lead all major strike operations, co-ordinating the attacks of the carrier's fighter, bomber, and torpedo planes in combat. The CAG was a department head of the ship reporting to the carrier's commanding officer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
captured_armor_brigade_website_desc;At various stages of the war each nation used captured armour to suppliment their own tanks. In the case of this unit, the captured armor assumes a more offical representation. Armor may have been captured enmass from an enemy encirclement or surrender and pressed into service. In some cases the armour might be rearmed with more compaitable guns and have its armor upgraded. Captured armor can be successful on secondary fronts, behind the line missions or upgraded to a more uptodate weapon such as a Tank Destroyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carrier_website_desc;An aircraft carrier is a warship with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft, that serves as a seagoing airbase. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. It is extremely expensive to build and important to protect. Aircraft carriers have evolved from converted cruisers to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cas_website_desc;In WW2 military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action by fixed-wing aircraft against hostile targets that are close to friendly ground or naval forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces.The determining factor for CAS is detailed integration, not proximity. CAS may need to be conducted far from friendly forces, if the mission requires detailed integration with the fire and movement of these forces.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> Due to their strong "hard attack" value, CAS aircraft are perfect counters to enemy armor units!</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cavalry_brigade_website_desc;Cavalry (from French cavalerie, cf. cheval 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback. Cavalry were historically the third oldest (after infantry and chariotry) and the most mobile of the combat arms. A soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman or trooper.\n\nIn the period between the World Wars, many cavalry units were converted into motorised infantry and mechanised infantry units, or reformed as tank troops. However some cavalry still served during the Second World War, notably in the Red Army, the Mongolian army, the Italian Royal Army and the Polish Army. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term refers to specialist units equipped with tanks ("armored cavalry") or aircraft ("air cavalry").;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
railway_artillery_brigade_website_desc;Super Heavy Artillery represents everything from coastal Guns to railway guns and super heavy artillery used at an Army command level. The unit can be a useful Garrison and defensive unit or as a powerful, though slow fort and Urban defense breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
coastal_battleship_website_desc;Coastal defence ships (sometimes called coastal battleships or coast defence ships) were warships built for the purpose of coastal defence, mostly during the period from 1860 to 1920. They were small, often cruiser-sized warships that sacrificed speed and range for armour and armament. They were usually attractive to nations that either could not afford full-sized battleships or that could be satisfied by specially designed shallow-draft vessels capable of littoral operations close to their own shores. The Nordic countries and Thailand found them particularly appropriate for their island-dotted coastal waters. Some vessels had limited blue-water capabilities; others operated in rivers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
coastal_submarine_website_desc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
combined_arms_brigade_website_desc;The Kampfgruppe and Allied Combat team/ ad hoc force can become available at various points in a game once certain triggers are met. These can be a certain province lost or gained and are based around a historical formation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
commando_brigade_website_desc;Commandos are soldiers or operatives of an elite light infantry or special operations force often specializing in amphibious landings, parachuting or abseiling. These units are small, highly mobile surprise raiding and reconnaissance forces capable of both bolstering the capabilities of larger divisional units, as well as operating in tandem with light infantry or naval infantry/marines. Army Commandos are all volunteers selected from existing soldiers in front line units and represent the best of the best.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> The perfect force multiplier for any situation. Commandos are expensive and take along time to build, but will work well with any brigade in any terrain or combat situation!</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Communist_militia_brigade_website_desc;Ideologically infused young men. These units are willing to fight and die for a politcal cause, in this case Communism. They have high morale and will often fight longer and take heavier losses then other units.They are also useful for supressing uprisings and controlling revolt risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
conscript_brigade_website_desc;Cannon fodder for a desperate defense. These units are weak and best used enmass, mostly to gain time until better units can be rushed to the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Convoy_raider_ship_website_desc;This unit becomes available once war has broken out and are created by upgrading a transport ship at a home port. They have long range and low visiblity and useful as convoy raiders in far flung places. If caught by an enemy combat ship, the convoy raiders are unlikley to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
motorized_infantry_bat_website_desc;This unit is the battalion-sized younger sibling to the full-fledged motorised infantry brigade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
destroyer_website_desc;In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast and maneuverable yet long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller, powerful, short-range attackers.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> Destroyers make excellent screens when grouped with capital ships, and excellent convoy escorts. However, they are rarely used without capital ship support due to their fragility and lack of firepower.</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
elite_light_infantry_battalion_website_desc;Pulled from the ranks of larger light infantry brigades, these soldiers comprise an elite infantry support force intended for difficult terrain such as mountains or jungle. Lacking heavy weapons and armored vehicles, they are not without their vulnerabilities. However, due to their ability to operate in difficult terrain, they make a great addition to most any divisional infantry force.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> These are special reward units earnable by completing commando missions. As a battalion-sized element, these won't make good front-line units. Instead, task them to larger infantry or amphibious assault divisions to add terrain and movement bonuses!</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
elite_light_infantry_brigade_website_desc;Formed by recruiting the best infantrymen in the service, these soldiers comprise an elite infantry force intended for difficult terrain such as mountains or jungle. Lacking heavy weapons and armored vehicles, they are not without their vulnerabilities. However, due to their ability to operate in difficult terrain, they make a great addition to most any divisional infantry force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_brigade_website_desc;Combat engineers, also called pioneers or sappers in many armies, are soldiers who perform a variety of construction and demolition tasks under combat conditions. Such tasks typically include constructing and breaching trenches, tank traps and other fortifications, bunker construction, bridge and road construction or destruction, laying or clearing land mines, and other physical work in the battlefield. More generally, the combat engineer's goals involve facilitating movement and support of friendly forces while impeding that of the enemy.\n\nUsually, a combat engineer is also trained as an infantryman, and combat engineering units often have a secondary role fighting as infantry. Beyond self-defense, combat engineers, infantry and assault troopers from armored corps units are generally the only troops that engage in the assault while dismounted. This role is limited by a lack of fire support (such as that obtained by infantry units from their mortars and recoilless rifles). However combat engineers typically do have extensive antiarmor capability in their infantry fighting role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
escort_carrier_website_desc;The escort carrier or escort aircraft carrier (hull classification symbol CVE), also called a "jeep carrier" or "baby flattop" in the USN or "Woolworth Carrier" by the Royal Navy, was a small and slow type of aircraft carrier used by the Royal Navy (RN), the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, and the United States Navy (USN) in World War II. They were typically half the length and 1/3 the displacement of the larger fleet carriers. While they were slower, less armed and armored, and carried fewer planes, they were less expensive and could be built in less time. This was their principal advantage, as escort carriers could be completed in greater numbers as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. However, the lack of protection made escort carriers particularly vulnerable and several were sunk with great loss of life. The light carrier (hull classification symbol CVL) was a similar concept to escort carriers in most respects, however they were intended for higher speeds to be deployed alongside fleet carriers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fascist_militia_brigade_website_desc;Ideologically infused young men. These units are willing to fight and die for a politcal cause, in this case Fascism.They have high morale and will often fight longer and take heavier losses then other units.They are also useful for supressing uprisings and controlling revolt risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Flying_boat_website_desc;A flying boat is a fixed-winged seaplane with a hull, allowing it to land on water. It differs from a float plane as it uses a purpose-designed fuselage which can float, granting the aircraft buoyancy. Flying boats may be stabilized by under-wing floats or by wing-like projections (called sponsons) from the fuselage. Flying boats were some of the largest aircraft of the first half of the 20th century, exceeded in size only by bombers developed during World War II.\n\nTheir advantage lay in using water instead of expensive land-based runways, making them the basis for international airlines in the interwar period. They were also commonly used for maritime patrol and air-sea rescue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
flying_bomb_website_desc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
flying_rocket_website_desc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frigate_website_desc;Modern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name. The term "frigate" was readopted during the Second World War by the Royal Navy to describe an anti-submarine escort vessel that was larger than a corvette, smaller than a destroyer, and were about equal in size and capability with the American destroyer escort.\n\nThe frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a destroyer, but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine warfare. As the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties, and not to deploy with the fleet, it had limited range and speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
garrison_brigade_website_desc;"Garrison" is the collective term for a body of troops stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it, but now often simply using it as a home base. The garrison is usually in a city, town, fort, castle or similar. "Garrison town" is a common expression for any town that has a military base nearby.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> While garrison brigades are considered mainline units, they are best used as affordable rear-guard units to help with revolt risk suppression, partisan attacks, and potential invasions from hostile countries</span>.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gliders_website_desc;Military gliders (an offshoot of common gliders) were used by the military of various countries for carrying troops and heavy equipment to combat zones, mainly during the Second World War. These engineless aircraft were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g. C-47 Skytrain or Dakota, or bombers relegated to secondary activities, e.g. Short Stirling. Once released from the tow craft near the front, they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to target, hopefully with as little damage to the cargo and crew as possible as most landing zones (LZ) were far from ideal. The one-way nature of the missions meant that they were treated as disposable leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood.\n\nTroops landing by glider were referred to as "air-landing" as opposed to paratroops. Landing by parachute caused the troops to be spread over a large drop-zone, whereas gliders could land troops in greater concentrations precisely at the target landing area. Furthermore, the glider, once released at some distance from the actual target, was effectively silent and difficult for the enemy to identify. Larger gliders were developed to land heavy equipment like anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, small vehicles, such as jeeps, and also light tanks (e.g. the Tetrarch tank). This heavier equipment made otherwise lightly armed paratroop forces a much more capable force. The Soviets also experimented with ways to deliver light tanks by air, including the Antonov A-40, a gliding tank with detachable wings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
goering_brigade_website_desc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
grossdeutschland_brigade_website_desc;The Panzer-Grenadier-Division Großdeutschland (also commonly referred to simply as Großdeutschland) was an elite combat unit of the Heer that fought on the Eastern Front in World War II. The Großdeutschland was considered to be the premier unit of the German Army and as such it was one of the best-equipped units of the Heer, receiving equipment before almost all other units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

heavy_armor_brigade_website_desc;A heavy tank was a subset of tank that provided equal or greater firepower as well as armor than tanks of lighter classes, at the cost of mobility and maneuverability.\n\nHeavy tanks have usually been deployed to breakthrough enemy lines, though in practice have been more useful in the defensive role than in the attack. Design goals have included attacking obstacles, creating breakthroughs, and engaging enemy armoured formations.\n\nHeavy tanks achieved their greatest successes both fighting other, lighter tanks, and destroying fortifications with their very large guns. Although it is often assumed that heavy tanks suffered inferior mobility to mediums, this was not always the case, as many of the more sophisticated heavy tank designs featured advanced suspension and transmission precisely to counteract this drawback. But the greatest drawback is cost which translates into production, resulting in short supplies. The German Tiger I, for example, had similar speed and better terrain-handling characteristics when compared to the significantly lighter Panzer IV medium tank, albeit at the cost of low reliability and only 1,355 were produced compared to 8,800 Panzer IV and 58,000 Soviet T-34 and 40,000 American M4 Sherman medium tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heavy_assault_gun_brigade_website_desc;An assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armored chassis, designed for use in the direct fire role in support of infantry when attacking other infantry or fortified positions. The term is a literal translation of the German word "Sturmgeschütz". Germany introduced the first purpose-built assault gun, the StuG III, in the late 1930s thus establishing this category of armoured vehicles.\n\nHistorically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a gun turret limited these weapons field of fire, but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armor to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heavy_cruiser_website_desc;The heavy cruiser is designed for long range and high speed, armed generally with naval guns of roughly 203mm calibre (8 inches in caliber) and displacing approximately 10,000 tons. The general mission of the heavy cruiser was to act as a fast scout for a battle fleet and protect and hunt down commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heavy_tank_destroyer_brigade_website_desc;A tank destroyer is a type of armored fighting vehicle armed with a main gun, and is designed specifically to engage enemy armored vehicles.\n\nTanks are generally armoured fighting vehicles designed for front-line combat which combines operational mobility and tactical offensive and defensive capabilities and perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops on the battlefield. The tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed mainly for taking on enemy armour. Many are based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HQDEF_brigade_website_desc;Unless a headquarters unit has attached brigades that can serve as a defense force, it is very vulnerable to attack. Having your headquarters unit shatter in the thick of a fight is never a positive thing. While you can attach various mainline and support brigades directly to your headquarters units, this can become prohibitively expensive, depending on your country's situation.\n\nThe Headquarters Defense Attachment can serve as a small protective force in those situations. While they are not capable of repelling a sustained concentrated attack, they can buy enough time for reinforcments to arrive, or to safely maneuver your HQ unit to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

infantry_tank_brigade_website_desc;The infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. Infantry tanks were designed to support foot soldiers in the attack. To achieve this, the vehicles were generally heavily armoured to allow them to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire. The extra armour came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow moving infantry.\n\nOnce the infantry tank-supported attack had broken through heavily defended areas in the enemy lines, other, tanks such as cruiser or light tanks, were expected to exploit their higher speed and longer range to operate far behind the front in order to cut lines of supply and communications.\n\nUsing later terminology, the infantry tank has been compared to a heavy tank, while the cruisers were compared to mediums, lights, or even armoured cars. This comparison can be misleading: particularly as the infantry tank was never intended to have the same anti-tank capabilities as a heavy tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

interceptor_website_desc;An interceptor aircraft, or simply interceptor, is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically to prevent successful missions by enemy aircraft, particularly bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. There are generally two classes of interceptors, light aircraft built for outright performance, and heavier aircraft designed to fight at night or heavy weather and operate over longer ranges.\n\nPrior to the start of the Second World War technology had improved so that it appeared that the interceptor mission would be effectively impossible. The visual and acoustic detection had a short range on the order of a few miles, and would not give interceptor enough time to climb to altitude before the bombers were already on their targets. This could be addressed through the use of a standing cover of aircraft, but only at enormous cost. The conclusion at the time was that "the bomber will always get through." The introduction of radar upset this equation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landing_craft_website_desc;Landing craft are boats and seagoing vessels used to convey a landing force (infantry and vehicles) from the sea to the shore during an amphibious assault. Most renowned are those used to storm the beaches of Normandy, the Mediterranean, and many Pacific islands during WWII. This was the high point of the landing craft, with a significant number of different designs produced in large quantities by the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nBecause of the need to run up onto a suitable beach, WWII landing craft were flat-bottomed, and many designs had a flat front, often with a lowerable ramp, rather than a normal bow. This made them difficult to control and very uncomfortable in rough seas. The control point (too rudimentary to call a bridge on LCA and similar craft) was normally at the extreme rear of the vessel, as were the engines. In all cases, they were known by an abbreviation derived from the official name rather than by the full title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kamikaze_brigade_website_desc;The Kamikaze (literally: "Spirit wind" or "Divine wind") has an official name of Tokubetsu Kogekitai (literally: "Special attack unit"). They were suicide attacks by military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II, designed to destroy warships more effectively than was possible with conventional attacks. Numbers quoted vary, but at least 47 Allied vessels, from PT boats to escort carriers, were sunk by kamikaze attacks, and about 300 damaged. During World War II, nearly 4,000 kamikaze pilots were killed. About 14% of kamikaze attacks managed to hit a ship.\n\nKamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles, purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a "Body Attack") in planes laden with some combination of explosives, bombs, torpedoes and full fuel tanks. Accuracy was much better than a conventional attack, and the payload larger. A kamikaze could sustain damage which would disable a conventional attacker and still achieve its objective. The goal of crippling or destroying large numbers of Allied ships, particularly aircraft carriers, was considered to justify sacrificing pilots and aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

light_armor_brigade_website_desc;A light tank is a tank variant initially designed for rapid movement, and now primarily employed in the reconnaissance role, or in support of expeditionary forces where main battle tanks cannot be made available. Early light tanks were generally armed and armored similar to an armored car, but used tracks in order to provide better cross-country mobility.\n\nThe fast light tank was a major feature of the pre-WWII buildup, where it was expected they would be used to exploit breakthroughs in enemy lines created by slower, heavier tanks. Numerous small tank designs and "tankettes" were developed during this period and known under a variety of names, including Combat Car.\n\nThe light tank has been one of the few tank variants to survive the development of the main battle tank, and has seen use in a variety of roles including support of light airborne or amphibious forces and reconnaissance. Modified IFVs are assuming these roles in many militaries due to their immediate availability, a cheaper alternative to developing and fielding a pure light tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

light_carrier_website_desc;A light aircraft carrier, or light fleet carrier, is an aircraft carrier that is smaller than the standard carriers of a navy. The precise definition of the type varies by country, but light carriers typically have a complement of aircraft only one-half to two-thirds the size of a full-sized fleet carrier. A light carrier was a similar concept to an escort carrier in most respects, however light carriers were intended for higher speeds to be deployed alongside fleet carriers, while escort carriers usually defended convoys and provided air support during amphibious operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
light_cruiser_website_desc;A light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship and is a shortening of the phrase "light armored cruiser", describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this, smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
light_infantry_brigade_website_desc;Traditionally light infantry (or skirmishers) were soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry foregoes heavy weapons and armor and/or have a reduced vehicle footprint. Light infantry units lack the greater firepower, tactical mobility and core defense possessed of heavy units, but possess greater operational mobility and the ability to execute missions under restrictive terrain and weather that would impair a heavy unit's mobility.\n\nLight infantry forces typically rely on their ability to operate under restrictive conditions, surprise, violence of action, training, stealth, field craft, and fitness level of the individual soldier to address their reduced lethality. Ironically, forces in a light unit will normally carry heavier individual loads versus other forces as they must carry everything they require to fight, survive and win due to lack of vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

marine_brigade_website_desc;Marines are an infantry force that specializes in naval operations such as amphibious assault. They are considered to be elite naval infantry. In the majority of countries, the marine force is part of the navy, but it can also be under the army or independent command.\n\nHistorically, tasks undertaken by marines have included providing protection from war while at sea, reflecting the pressed nature of the ships' company and the risk of mutiny. Other tasks would include boarding of vessels during combat or capture of prize ships and providing manpower for raiding ashore in support of the naval objectives. Marine elements would also contribute to the campaign ashore, in support of the military objective.\n\nWith the industrialization of warfare in the 20th century the scale of landing operations increased and thus brought with it an increased likelihood of opposition and a need for co-ordination of various military elements. Marine forces evolved to specialize in the skills and capabilities required for amphibious warfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mechanized_brigade_website_desc;Mechanized infantry is infantry equipped with armored personnel carriers (APCs) or infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) for transport and combat. Mechanized infantry is distinguished from motorized infantry in that its vehicles provide a degree of protection from hostile fire, as opposed to "soft-skinned" wheeled vehicles (trucks or jeeps) for motorized infantry. Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked, or are all-wheel drive vehicles (6×6 or 8×8), for mobility across rough ground. Some nations distinguish between mechanized and armored infantry, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armored.\n\nThe support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with motorized transport, or are built directly into combat vehicles, in order to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. For units equipped with most types of APC or any type of IFV, fire support weapons, such as machine guns, autocannons, small-bore direct-fire howitzers, and even anti-tank weapons, are often mounted directly on the infantry's own transport vehicles.\n\nCompared with "light" truck-mobile infantry, mechanized infantry can maintain rapid tactical movement and (if mounted in IFVs) possess more integral firepower. They require more combat supplies (ammunition and especially fuel) and ordnance supplies (spare vehicle components), and a comparatively larger proportion of their manpower is required to crew and maintain the vehicles. For example, most APCs mount a section of seven or eight infantrymen, but have a crew of two. Most IFVs only carry six or seven infantry, but require a crew of three. To be effective in the field, mechanized units also require large numbers of mechanics with specialized maintenance and recovery vehicles and equipment. Light infantry are more effective when fighting from prepared defence positions, but are more vulnerable than mechanized infantry on the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

midget_submarine_website_desc;A midget submarine is any submarine under 150 tons typically operated by a crew of one or two but sometimes up to 6 or 8, with little or no on-board living accommodation. Midget submarines normally work with mother ships, from which they are launched and recovered, and which provide living accommodation for the crew and other support staff.\n\nThe best known role for midget submarines is probably harbor penetration, although only two World War II boats, the British X-craft and the unsuccessful Welman submarine were specifically designed with this in mind. Japan's Ko-hyoteki class submarines were originally designed to take part in decisive fleet actions. However, as circumstances changed, they ended up tasked with harbour penetration. Germany's various World War II designs were mostly designed to attack Allied shipping off landing beaches and harbours, although the Seehund had a great enough range to attack shipping off the Thames estuary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

motorcycle_recon_brigade_website_desc;While WWII is often said to be the heyday of the military motorcycle, it actually played a much reduced role compared to the direct combat operations they saw in WWI, primarily due to the predominance of mobile armor in use by the 1940s.

medium_artillery_brigade_website_desc;Motorized artillery is an indirect fire unit equipped with artillery guns (typically cannons or howitzers) that are towed behind motor-vehicles such as transport trucks. They are designed to provide accompanying fire and to effect fire support to motorized (mechanized) infantry and armored forces in combat. Unlike self-propelled artillery, they lack bulletproof or shellproof armor. Compared to traditional horse-drawn artillery, motorized artillery has a high traveling speed and better cross-country ability and requires a smaller guncrew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
motorized_brigade_website_desc;Motorised infantry is infantry that is transported by trucks or other soft-skinned motor vehicles. It is distinguished from mechanized infantry, which is carried in armoured personnel carriers, infantry combat vehicles, or infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nMotorising infantry is the first stage towards the mechanisation of an army. Civilian trucks are readily adaptable to military uses of transporting soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. This greatly increases the strategic mobility of infantry units, which would otherwise rely on marches or railroads. In practice, armies have found it advantageous to develop trucks to military specifications, such as all-wheel drive, in order to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain.\n\nMotorisation provides no direct tactical advantage in small unit combat, because trucks and jeeps are vulnerable to artillery and small arms fire. However, in larger battles, motorized infantry have an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, as well as the ability to outmaneuver the enemy.\n\nThe disadvantage of motorisation is that the formation requires many vehicles and supplies of fuel to be of advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

motor_torpedo_boat_website_desc;Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) was the name given to fast torpedo boats by the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy. The 'motor' in the formal designation, referring to the use of petrol engines, was to distinguish them from the majority of other naval craft that used steam turbines or reciprocating steam engines. The capitalised term is generally used for the Royal Navy (RN) boats and abbreviated to "MTB". During the Second World War the US Navy boats were usually called by their hull classification symbol of "PT" (Patrol, Torpedo), and are covered under PT boat although the class type were still "motor torpedo boats".\n\nGerman motor torpedo boats of the Second World War were called S-boote (Schnellboote, "fast boats") by the Kriegsmarine and "E-boats" by the Allies. Italian MTBs of this period were known as Motoscafo Armato Silurante ("MAS boats", torpedo armed motorboats). French MTBs were known as vedettes lance torpilles ("torpedo-launching fast boats"). Soviet MTBs were known as "torpedo cutters".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
multi_role_website_desc;A ground attack aircraft (also called a strike aircraft or attack bomber) is tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of attacking targets on the ground or sea, with greater precision than bombers, and which is prepared to encounter stronger low-level air defenses.\n\nWhile machine guns and cannon were sufficient against infantry and light vehicles, for operations against tanks heavier weapons were needed such as the 40 mm Vickers S gun which equipped the Hawker Hurricane to good effect in North Africa Campaign (notably No. 6 Squadron RAF). High explosive rockets were used by British, U.S., Soviet and German aircraft though they were (along with bombs) found to be "barely adequate" because of their inaccuracy. Official opinion was that for the British RP3 one hit per sortie was acceptable. Though unlikely to directly hit and therefore destroy armoured vehicles, the rockets did have a significant effect on soft targets and the "taxi rank" patrols of rocket-armed aircraft over the Normandy disrupted or even completely paralysed road traffic. They also affected enemy morale - even the prospect of a rocket attack was unnerving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nuclear_submarine_website_desc;A nuclear submarine is a submarine powered by a nuclear reactor. The performance advantages of nuclear submarines over "conventional" (typically diesel-electric) submarines are considerable: nuclear propulsion, being completely independent of air, frees the submarine from the need to surface frequently, as is necessary for conventional submarines - the large amount of power generated by a nuclear reactor allows nuclear submarines to operate at high speed for long durations - and the long interval between refuellings grants a range limited only by consumables such as food. Current generations of nuclear submarines never need to be refueled throughout their 25-year lifespans. Conversely, the limited power stored in electric batteries means that even the most advanced conventional submarine can only remain submerged for a few days at slow speed, and only a few hours at top speed. The high cost of nuclear technology means that relatively few states have fielded nuclear submarines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

paratrooper_brigade_website_desc;Paratroopers are military parachutists - soldiers, marines, and others trained in parachuting into an operation and usually functioning as part of an airborne force. They are used for tactical advantage as they can be inserted into the battlefield from the air, thereby allowing them to be positioned in areas not accessible by land. It is one of the three types of "forced entry" strategic techniques for entering a theater of war - the other two are by land and sea.\n\nThe ability to enter the battle from different locations allows paratroopers to evade fortifications that are in place to prevent attack from a specific direction, and the possible use of paratroopers forces an army to spread their defences to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe by virtue of the geography.\n\nAnother common use for paratroopers is to establish an airhead for landing other units. Paratroopers are also trained in conducting drop zones, pickup zones, and landing sites for various aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

rocket_artillery_brigade_website_desc;Rocket artillery is a type of artillery equipped with rocket launchers instead of conventional guns or mortars.\n\nModern rocket artillery was first employed during World War II, in the form of the German Nebelwerfer and Soviet Katyusha-series. The Soviet Katyushas, nicknamed by German troops Stalin's Organ because of their visual resemblance to a church musical organ and alluding to the sound of the weapon's rockets, were mounted on trucks or light tanks, while the early German Nebelwerfer were mounted on a small wheeled carriage which was light enough to be moved by several men and could easily be deployed nearly anywhere, while also being towed by most vehicles. The Germans also had self-propelled rocket artillery in the form of the Panzerwerfer and Wurfrahmen 40 which equipped half-track armoured fighting vehicles. An oddity in the subject of rocket artillery during this time was the German "Sturmtiger", a vehicle based on the Tiger I heavy tank chassis that was armed with a 380 mm rocket mortar.\n\nThe Western Allies of World War II employed little rocket artillery. During later periods of the war, British and Canadian troops used the Land Mattress, a towed rocket launcher. The United States Army built and deployed a small number of T34 Calliope and T40 Whizbang rocket artillery tanks (converted from M4 Sherman medium tanks) in France and Italy. In 1945, the British Army also fitted some M4 Shermans with two 60 lb RP3 rockets, the same as used on ground attack aircraft and known as Tulip.\n\nIn the Pacific, however, the US Navy made heavy use of rocket artillery, adding to the already intense bombardment by the guns of heavy warships to soften up Japanese-held islands before the US Marines would land. On Iwo Jima, the Marines made use of rocket artillery trucks in a similar fashion as the Soviet Katyusha, but on a smaller scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rocket_interceptor_website_desc;A "jet fighter" is a jet-engine-powered military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a jet fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.\n\nFighter technology advanced rapidly during the Second World War. Piston-engines, which powered the vast majority of World War II fighters, grew more powerful: at the beginning of the war fighters typically had engines producing between 1,000 hp (750 kW) and 1,400 hp (1,000 kW), while by the end of the war many could produce over 2,000 hp (1,500 kW). For example, the Spitfire, one of the few fighters in continuous production throughout the war, was in 1939 powered by a 1,030 hp (770 kW) Merlin II, while variants produced in 1945 were equipped with the 2,035 hp (1,517 kW) Griffon 61. Nevertheless, these fighters could only achieve modest increases in top speed due to problems of compressibility created as aircraft and their propellers approached the sound barrier, and it was apparent that propeller-driven aircraft were approaching the limits of their performance. German jet and rocket powered fighters entered combat in 1944, although too late to impact the war's outcome. The same year the Allies' only operational jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor, also entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rocket_interceptor_van_website_desc;A rocket-powered aircraft or rocket plane is an aircraft that uses a rocket for propulsion, sometimes in addition to airbreathing jet engines. Rocket planes can achieve much higher speeds than similarly sized jet aircraft, but typically for at most a few minutes of powered operation, followed by a glide. Unhindered by the need for oxygen from the atmosphere they are suitable for very high altitude flight. They are also capable of delivering much higher acceleration and shorter takeoffs.\n\nThe first rocket-powered aircraft was the Lippisch Ente, which made a successful maiden flight in March 1928. The only pure rocket aircraft ever mass-produced was the Messerschmitt Me 163 in 1944, one of several German World War II projects aimed at developing rocket-powered aircraft. Later variants of the Me 262 (C-1a and C-2b) were also fitted with rocket powerplants, while earlier models were fitted with rocket boosters, but were not mass-produced with these modifications.\n\nThe USSR experimented with a rocket-powered interceptor in the years immediately following World War II, the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270. Only two were built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

semi_motorized_brigade_website_desc;Stuck somewhere between a traditional infantry brigade and a true "motorised" infantry brigade, "semi-motorised" infantry units have motorised heavy equipment and limited truck transports. Unlike motorised infantry, semi-motorised are not truly mobile troops.\n\nWith limited mobility, they have some tactical advantages over an opponent, however, they lack the full mobility to deploy as efficiently as a fully motorised (or mechanized) unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ski_brigade_website_desc;Ski warfare, the use of ski-equipped troops in war, is first recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The speed and distance that ski troopers are able to cover is comparable to that of light cavalry.\n\nSki troopers played a key role in the successes of the Finnish war effort against the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939. Forested, rural terrain with no roads was used by Finnish ski troopers with great success against the advancing mechanized Soviet troops. Most notably, in Battle of Suomussalmi, two Soviet mechanized divisions (45,000 men) were annihilated by three Finnish regiments (11,000 men). Perhaps learning from the Finns, the Soviet Union deployed several ski battalions during World War II, notably in their 1941 counterattack in the Battle of Moscow.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> It goes without saying that if you are planning on fighting in arctic terrain, these make the best option as far as infantry goes.

sp_artillery_brigade_website_desc;Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on caterpillar track carrying either a large howitzer or other field gun or alternatively a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield.\n\nThe key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought - usually towed - to the new location. By comparison self-propelled artillery can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.\n\nConversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sp_anti_air_brigade_website_desc;A self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, or larger guns. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pack_artillery_brigade_website_desc;Pack artillery includes any artillery designed for portability through reduced weight and the ability to be broken down into separate loads. Pack artillery is able to be deployed by pack animals or human porters.\n\nMountain artillery, which includes pack howitzers, mountain howitzers and mountain guns, is designed to accompany mountain infantry forces. Usually lightweight and designed to be broken down to be portable by pack animals or even soldiers, they often are in limited calibres with low muzzle energy. Correspondingly, range and anti-armor capabilities are limited. However, they can deliver useful firepower in locations that may be inaccessible to heavier support forces. An example would be during amphibious landings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ss_anti_air_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Anti Air Battalion.\n\nThese are artillery pieces fired from the ground in defense against aerial attack. They were first used in combat in World War I, when field artillery were converted to antiaircraft use by mountings that enabled them to fire nearly vertically. Range finders and searchlights, developed in the 1920s and '30s, increased their effectiveness. Advances in World War II included rapid-firing and automatic weapons, radar for target tracking, and radio-operated fuses.\n\nBritish and U.S. forces used a 40-mm gun that fired ammunition to a height of 2 mi (3.2 km). Heavier guns, up to 120 mm, were used against high-flying bombers. For most of the war, the most effective was the German 88-mm Fliegerabwehrkanone. Its abbreviated name, "flak", became a universal term for antiaircraft fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_anti_tank_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Anti Tank Battalion.\n\nAnti-tank warfare arose as a result of the need to develop technology and tactics to destroy tanks during the First World War. Because tanks represent an enemy's greatest force projection (aside from nuclear artillery and tanks vs. tank engagements), anti-tank warfare has been incorporated into the doctrine of nearly every combat service since.\n\nAnti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. In order to penetrate vehicle armor they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are howitzers. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory ballistics provide terminal kinetic energy to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ss_armored_engineers_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Armoured Engineers Battalion.\n\nTypically based on the platform of a main battle tank, these vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the US the term "combat engineer vehicle (CEV)" is used, in the UK the term "Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)" is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term "armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)" is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes or lifting booms.\n\nThese vehicles are designed to directly conduct obstacle breaching operations and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. It should be noted that while the term "armoured engineer vehicle" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ss_artillery_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Artillery Regiment.\n\nThe Field Artillery is one of the Army's combat arms, traditionally one of the three major branches (with Infantry and Armor). It refers to those units that use artillery weapons systems to deliver surface-to-surface long range indirect fire. Indirect fire means that the projectile does not follow the line of sight to the target. Mortars are not field artillery weapons - they are organic to infantry units and are manned by infantry personnel.\n\nField artillery is called the "King of Battle". Conflicts in the 20th century saw artillery become exponentially more effective as indirect fire methods were introduced immediately prior to World War I. During World War I and World War II, field artillery was the single highest casualty-producing weapons system on any battlefield.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> No division is complete without some form of artillery support, and this unit makes a great complement in those pre- and early-war infantry divisions.</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_bergsjaeger_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Mountain Infantry Brigade.\n\nGebirgsjäger are the light infantry part of the alpine or mountain troops (Gebirgstruppe) of Germany and Austria. The word Jäger (meaning "hunter" or "huntsman") is a characteristic term used for light-infantry or light-infantryman in German-speaking military context.\n\nThe mountain infantry of Austria have their roots in the three Landesschützen regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The mountain infantry of Germany carry on certain traditions of the Alpenkorps (Alpine corps) of World War I. Both countries' mountain infantry share the Edelweiß insignia. It was established in 1907 as a symbol of the Austro-Hungarian Landesschützen regiments by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These troops wore their edelweiss on the collar of their uniforms. When the Alpenkorps came to aid the Landesschützen in defending Austria-Hungary's southern frontier against the Italian attack in May 1915, the grateful Landesschützen honoured the men of the Alpenkorps by awarding them their own insignia: the edelweiss.\n\nTogether with the Fallschirmjäger (Paratroopers) they are perceived as the elite infantry units of the German Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_cavalry_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Cavalry Regiment.\n\nCavalry (from French cavalerie, cf. cheval 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback. Cavalry were historically the third oldest (after infantry and chariotry) and the most mobile of the combat arms. A soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman or trooper.\n\nIn the period between the World Wars, many cavalry units were converted into motorised infantry and mechanised infantry units, or reformed as tank troops. However some cavalry still served during the Second World War, notably in the Red Army, the Mongolian army, the Italian Royal Army and the Polish Army. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term refers to specialist units equipped with tanks ("armored cavalry") or aircraft ("air cavalry").;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_commando_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Commando Group.\n\nCommandos are soldiers or operatives of an elite light infantry or special operations force often specializing in amphibious landings, parachuting or abseiling. These units are small, highly mobile surprise raiding and reconnaissance forces capable of both bolstering the capabilities of larger divisional units, as well as operating in tandem with light infantry or naval infantry/marines. Army Commandos are all volunteers selected from existing soldiers in front line units and represent the best of the best.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> The perfect force multiplier for any situation.

ss_dasreich_website_desc;The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich was an elite division during World War II. It is considered to be one of the better fighting formations amongst the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS.\n\nIt served during the invasion of France and took part in several major battles on the Eastern Front (particularly in the Battle of Prokhorovka against the 5th Guards Tank Army at the titanic Battle of Kursk). It was then transferred to the West and took part in the fighting in Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, ending the war with desperate fighting in Hungary and Austria.\n\nThe symbol for the Das Reich division was the wolf's hook, or Wolfsangel.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ss_engineer_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Engineer Battalion.\n\nCombat engineers, also called pioneers or sappers in many armies, are soldiers who perform a variety of construction and demolition tasks under combat conditions. Such tasks typically include constructing and breaching trenches, tank traps and other fortifications, bunker construction, bridge and road construction or destruction, laying or clearing land mines, and other physical work in the battlefield. More generally, the combat engineer's goals involve facilitating movement and support of friendly forces while impeding that of the enemy.\n\nUsually, a combat engineer is also trained as an infantryman, and combat engineering units often have a secondary role fighting as infantry. Beyond self-defense, combat engineers, infantry and assault troopers from armored corps units are generally the only troops that engage in the assault while dismounted. This role is limited by a lack of fire support (such as that obtained by infantry units from their mortars and recoilless rifles). However combat engineers typically do have extensive antiarmor capability in their infantry fighting role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_florian_geyer_website_desc;The 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer was a Waffen-SS cavalry Division during World War II. It was formed in 1942 from a cadre of the SS Cavalry Brigade.\n\nAbout 40% of the division were Volksdeutsche from Siebenbürgen (Transylvania) and Banat (Serbia). The Training and Replacement Battalion of the 8th SS Cavalry Division was involved in suppressing the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.In March 1944, it was named after Florian Geyer (1490-1525), the Franconian nobleman who led the Black Company during the German Peasants' War. The Division was destroyed during the fighting in Budapest in early 1945.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_frundsberg_website_desc;The 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg or 10.SS-Panzer-Division Frundsberg was a German Waffen SS panzer division. The division was formed at the beginning of 1943 as a reserve for the expected Allied invasion of France. However, their first campaign was in Ukraine in April 1944. Highly motivated after combat success in Ukraine, the unit was then transported back to the west where they fought the Allies in France and at Arnhem. The division was later transported to Pomerania then fought south east of Berlin in the Lausitz area to the end of the war. Unlike several of the earlier SS panzer divisions, the "Frundsberg" division did not engage in atrocities against either civilians or combatants. Based on its fighting record, it was an elite division which also had a reputation of fighting a "clean war." Postwar, the division had a very active veteran's association.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_garrison_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Garrison brigade.\n\n"Garrison" is the collective term for a body of troops stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it, but now often simply using it as a home base. The garrison is usually in a city, town, fort, castle or similar. "Garrison town" is a common expression for any town that has a military base nearby.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> While garrison brigades are considered mainline units, they are best used as affordable rear-guard units to help with revolt risk suppression, partisan attacks, and potential invasions from hostile countries</span>.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_heavy_armor_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Heavy Armor Battalion.\n\nA heavy tank was a subset of tank that provided equal or greater firepower as well as armor than tanks of lighter classes, at the cost of mobility and maneuverability.\n\nHeavy tanks have usually been deployed to breakthrough enemy lines, though in practice have been more useful in the defensive role than in the attack. Design goals have included attacking obstacles, creating breakthroughs, and engaging enemy armoured formations.\n\nHeavy tanks achieved their greatest successes both fighting other, lighter tanks, and destroying fortifications with their very large guns. Although it is often assumed that heavy tanks suffered inferior mobility to mediums, this was not always the case, as many of the more sophisticated heavy tank designs featured advanced suspension and transmission precisely to counteract this drawback. But the greatest drawback is cost which translates into production, resulting in short supplies. The German Tiger I, for example, had similar speed and better terrain-handling characteristics when compared to the significantly lighter Panzer IV medium tank, albeit at the cost of low reliability and only 1,355 were produced compared to 8,800 Panzer IV and 58,000 Soviet T-34 and 40,000 American M4 Sherman medium tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_hitlerjugend_website_desc;The 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth") was a German Waffen-SS armoured division during World War II. The Hitlerjugend was unique because the majority of its junior enlisted men were drawn from members of the Hitler Youth, while the senior NCOs and officers were generally veterans of the Eastern Front.\n\nThe division, with 20,540 personnel, first saw action on 7 June 1944 as part of the German defense of the Caen area during the Normandy campaign. The battle for Normandy took its toll on the division and it came out of the Falaise pocket with a divisional strength of 12,000 men.\n\nFollowing the invasion battles, the division was sent to Germany for refitting. On 16 December 1944, the division was committed against the US Army in the Battle of the Bulge. After the failure of the Ardennes offensive the division was sent east to fight the Red Army near Budapest. The 12th SS eventually withdrew into Austria - on 8 May 1945, the surviving 10,000 men surrendered to the US Army at Enns. At 7:20 am, Captain McLean reported that two lieutenant colonels and a major approached troops of Major General Stanley Eric Reinhart, announcing that within two hours the end of their column would reach the city.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_hohenstaufen_website_desc;The 9th SS Panzer Division "Hohenstaufen", also known as SS-Panzergrenadier-Division 9, SS-Panzergrenadier-Division 9 Hohenstaufen or 9. SS-Panzer-Division Hohenstaufen, was a German Waffen-SS Armoured division which saw action on both the Eastern and Western Fronts during World War II.\n\nThe division was activated on the 31 December 1942. The men of the division were German conscripts aged 18, with a cadre of experienced staff from the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. Their first action was in March 1944 in Poland - they were then moved to Normandy in June that year. After the retreat from France, they were moved to Arnhem in September 1944, to rest and refit and became involved in the Allied parachute landings. Their next action was the German advance in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944-1945. After defeat in the Ardennes, the division was moved to Hungary, where it took part in the fighting to the west of Budapest in February and March. Falling back into Austria, the division surrendered to the advancing United States Army on 5 May 1945, at Steyr.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_hq_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard HQ unit.\n\nLike all headquarter units, the standard Headquarters unit plans, directs, controls, and coordinates the operations of subordinate combat units, and can employ a mix of combat and combat support brigades itself.

ss_infantry_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Infantry Brigade.\n\nThis is the traditional, and baseline, Infantry unit.\n\nInfantry is the branch of an army that fights on foot - Soldiers specifically trained to engage, fight, and defeat the enemy in face-to-face combat, and thus bear the brunt of warfare, and suffer the greatest number of casualties. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the backbone of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is more physically stressful and psychologically demanding than that of any other branch of the combat arms, or of the army, emphasizing teamwork in the deployment of spontaneous, sustained aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_lssah_website_desc;The 1st SS-Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ((abbreviated 1st SS-Pz.Div. LSSAH)) was Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguard. Initially the size of a regiment (brigade), the LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division-sized unit. The term Leibstandarte was derived partly from Leibgarde - a somewhat archaic German translation of "Garde du Corps" or personal bodyguard of a military leader ("Leib" = lit. "body, torso") - and Standarte: the Schutzstaffel (SS) or Sturmabteilung (SA) term for a regiment-sized unit.\n\nThe LSSAH independently participated in combat during the invasion of Poland, and was amalgamated into the Waffen-SS together with the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) and the combat units of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) prior to Operation Barbarossa in 1941. By the end of World War II it had been increased in size from a regiment to a Panzer division.\n\nThe Leibstandarte division's symbol was a skeleton key, in honour of its first commander, Josef "Sepp" Dietrich (Dietrich is German for skeleton key or lock pick); it was retained and modified to later serve as the symbol for I SS Panzer Corps.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_mechanized_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Mechanized Infantry Brigade.\n\nMechanized infantry is infantry equipped with armored personnel carriers (APCs) or infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) for transport and combat. Mechanized infantry is distinguished from motorized infantry in that its vehicles provide a degree of protection from hostile fire, as opposed to "soft-skinned" wheeled vehicles (trucks or jeeps) for motorized infantry. Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked, or are all-wheel drive vehicles (6×6 or 8×8), for mobility across rough ground. Some nations distinguish between mechanized and armored infantry, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armored.\n\nThe support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with motorized transport, or are built directly into combat vehicles, in order to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. For units equipped with most types of APC or any type of IFV, fire support weapons, such as machine guns, autocannons, small-bore direct-fire howitzers, and even anti-tank weapons, are often mounted directly on the infantry's own transport vehicles.\n\nCompared with "light" truck-mobile infantry, mechanized infantry can maintain rapid tactical movement and (if mounted in IFVs) possess more integral firepower. They require more combat supplies (ammunition and especially fuel) and ordnance supplies (spare vehicle components), and a comparatively larger proportion of their manpower is required to crew and maintain the vehicles. For example, most APCs mount a section of seven or eight infantrymen, but have a crew of two. Most IFVs only carry six or seven infantry, but require a crew of three. To be effective in the field, mechanized units also require large numbers of mechanics with specialized maintenance and recovery vehicles and equipment. Light infantry are more effective when fighting from prepared defence positions, but are more vulnerable than mechanized infantry on the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_mech_hq_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Mechanized Infantry HQ Unit.\n\nLike all headquarter units, the Mechanized Headquarters plans, directs, controls, and coordinates the operations of subordinate combat units, and can employ a mix of combat and combat support brigades itself. It provides command, control, staff planning, and supervision of subordinate units, and establishes a Rear Command Post, Main Command Post, and a Forward Tactical Command Post.\n\nMechanized Headquarter units have several advantages over traditional HQ units. In addition to significant increases in direct combat capabilities, they excel at leading fast, highly mobile subordinate units such as mechanized infantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;

ss_motorized_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Motorised Infantry Brigade.\n\nMotorised infantry is infantry that is transported by trucks or other soft-skinned motor vehicles. It is distinguished from mechanized infantry, which is carried in armoured personnel carriers, infantry combat vehicles, or infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nMotorising infantry is the first stage towards the mechanisation of an army. Civilian trucks are readily adaptable to military uses of transporting soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. This greatly increases the strategic mobility of infantry units, which would otherwise rely on marches or railroads. In practice, armies have found it advantageous to develop trucks to military specifications, such as all-wheel drive, in order to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain.\n\nMotorisation provides no direct tactical advantage in small unit combat, because trucks and jeeps are vulnerable to artillery and small arms fire. However, in larger battles, motorized infantry have an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, as well as the ability to outmaneuver the enemy.\n\nThe disadvantage of motorisation is that the formation requires many vehicles and supplies of fuel to be of advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_mot_hq_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Motorised Infantry HQ Unit.\n\nLike all headquarter units, the Motorized Headquarters plans, directs, controls, and coordinates the operations of subordinate combat units, and can employ a mix of combat and combat support brigades itself.

ss_motorcycle_recon_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Motorcycle Recon Battalion.\n\nWhile WWII is often said to be the heyday of the military motorcycle, it actually played a much reduced role compared to the direct combat operations they saw in WWI, primarily due to the predominance of mobile armor in use by the 1940s. Where motorcycles really found their stride in the European theater was again as recon specialists, and in the transportation choice of messengers, helping to close the wide distances between mobile forward units.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> Weaker than armored cars, but considerably cheaper and fuel efficient, these are the ideal recon unit for any situation, especially in the early-to-mid war. Perfect for combining with HQ units for added mobility. This unit can also be transported by Gliders and Transport planes (i.e. they are air droppable!).

They are designed to provide accompanying fire and to effect fire support to motorized (mechanized) infantry and armored forces in combat. Unlike self-propelled artillery, they lack bulletproof or shellproof armor. Compared to traditional horse-drawn artillery, motorized artillery has a high traveling speed and better cross-country ability and requires a smaller guncrew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ss_paratrooper_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Paratrooper Brigade.\n\nParatroopers are military parachutists - soldiers, marines, and others trained in parachuting into an operation and usually functioning as part of an airborne force. They are used for tactical advantage as they can be inserted into the battlefield from the air, thereby allowing them to be positioned in areas not accessible by land. It is one of the three types of "forced entry" strategic techniques for entering a theater of war - the other two are by land and sea.\n\nThe ability to enter the battle from different locations allows paratroopers to evade fortifications that are in place to prevent attack from a specific direction, and the possible use of paratroopers forces an army to spread their defences to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe by virtue of the geography.\n\nAnother common use for paratroopers is to establish an airhead for landing other units. Paratroopers are also trained in conducting drop zones, pickup zones, and landing sites for various aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_police_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Military Police Brigade.\n\nMilitary police (MP) are police organizations connected with, or part of, the military of a state.

ss_rocket_artillery_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Rocket Artillery Regiment.\n\nRocket artillery is a type of artillery equipped with rocket launchers instead of conventional guns or mortars.\n\nModern rocket artillery was first employed during World War II, in the form of the German Nebelwerfer and Soviet Katyusha-series. The Soviet Katyushas, nicknamed by German troops Stalin's Organ because of their visual resemblance to a church musical organ and alluding to the sound of the weapon's rockets, were mounted on trucks or light tanks, while the early German Nebelwerfer were mounted on a small wheeled carriage which was light enough to be moved by several men and could easily be deployed nearly anywhere, while also being towed by most vehicles. The Germans also had self-propelled rocket artillery in the form of the Panzerwerfer and Wurfrahmen 40 which equipped half-track armoured fighting vehicles. An oddity in the subject of rocket artillery during this time was the German "Sturmtiger", a vehicle based on the Tiger I heavy tank chassis that was armed with a 380 mm rocket mortar.\n\nThe Western Allies of World War II employed little rocket artillery. During later periods of the war, British and Canadian troops used the Land Mattress, a towed rocket launcher. The United States Army built and deployed a small number of T34 Calliope and T40 Whizbang rocket artillery tanks (converted from M4 Sherman medium tanks) in France and Italy. In 1945, the British Army also fitted some M4 Shermans with two 60 lb RP3 rockets, the same as used on ground attack aircraft and known as Tulip.\n\nIn the Pacific, however, the US Navy made heavy use of rocket artillery, adding to the already intense bombardment by the guns of heavy warships to soften up Japanese-held islands before the US Marines would land. On Iwo Jima, the Marines made use of rocket artillery trucks in a similar fashion as the Soviet Katyusha, but on a smaller scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_ski_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Ski Troopers Brigade.\n\nSki warfare, the use of ski-equipped troops in war, is first recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The speed and distance that ski troopers are able to cover is comparable to that of light cavalry.\n\nSki troopers played a key role in the successes of the Finnish war effort against the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939. Forested, rural terrain with no roads was used by Finnish ski troopers with great success against the advancing mechanized Soviet troops. Most notably, in Battle of Suomussalmi, two Soviet mechanized divisions (45,000 men) were annihilated by three Finnish regiments (11,000 men). Perhaps learning from the Finns, the Soviet Union deployed several ski battalions during World War II, notably in their 1941 counterattack in the Battle of Moscow.\n\n<span style="color:gold"><strong>TIP:</strong> It goes without saying that if you are planning on fighting in arctic terrain, these make the best option as far as infantry goes. They also perform fairly well in mountainous terrain as well!</span>;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_sp_anti_air_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard SP Anti-Air Battalion.\n\nA self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, or larger guns. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_sp_artillery_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard SP Artillery Regiment.\n\nSelf-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on caterpillar track carrying either a large howitzer or other field gun or alternatively a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield.\n\nThe key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought - usually towed - to the new location. By comparison self-propelled artillery can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.\n\nConversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_pack_artillery_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Pack Artillery Regiment.\n\nPack artillery includes any artillery designed for portability through reduced weight and the ability to be broken down into separate loads. Pack artillery is able to be deployed by pack animals or human porters.\n\nMountain artillery, which includes pack howitzers, mountain howitzers and mountain guns, is designed to accompany mountain infantry forces. Usually lightweight and designed to be broken down to be portable by pack animals or even soldiers, they often are in limited calibres with low muzzle energy. Correspondingly, range and anti-armor capabilities are limited. However, they can deliver useful firepower in locations that may be inaccessible to heavier support forces. An example would be during amphibious landings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_sp_rct_artillery_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard SP Rocket Artillery Regiment.\n\nSelf-propelled rocket artillery consists of rocket artillery weaponry mounted onto a vehicle.

ss_tank_destroyer_brigade_website_desc;This is the Nazi equivalent of the standard Tank Destroyer battalion.\n\nA tank destroyer is a type of armored fighting vehicle armed with a main gun, and is designed specifically to engage enemy armored vehicles.\n\nTanks are generally armoured fighting vehicles designed for front-line combat which combines operational mobility and tactical offensive and defensive capabilities and perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops on the battlefield. The tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed mainly for taking on enemy armour. Many are based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_totenkopf_website_desc;The 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf (skull), also known as the 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf and 3rd SS Division Totenkopf during its existence, was one of 38 divisions of the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II. Prior to achieving division status, the formation was known as Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) "Eicke". The division is infamous due to its insignia and the fact that most of the initial enlisted soldiers were SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS camp guards), and as such it is sometimes referred to as the "Death's Head Division". The Totenkopf division was one of the "Germanic" divisions of the Waffen-SS. These included 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, and 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ss_wiking_website_desc;The 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking was one of the elite Panzer divisions of the thirty eight Waffen SS divisions. It was recruited from foreign volunteers in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, the Netherlands and Belgium under the command of German officers. During the course of World War II, the division progressed from a motorised infantry formation to a Panzer division and served on the Eastern Front during World War II. It surrendered in May 1945 to the advancing American forces in Austria.\n\nThis is a unique unit for Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strategic_bomber_website_desc;A strategic bomber is a mid-to-long range heavy bomber aircraft designed to drop large amounts of ordnance onto a distant target for the purposes of debilitating the enemy's capacity to wage war. Unlike tactical bombers and ground attack aircraft, which are used in air interdiction operations to attack troops and military equipment, strategic bombers are built to fly into enemy territory to destroy strategic targets (e.g., major military installations, factories, and cities). In addition to strategic bombing, strategic bombers can be used for tactical missions.\n\nBy the end of the Second World War in 1945, the "heavy" bomber, epitomized by the British Avro Lancaster and American B-29 used in the Pacific Theater, showed what could be accomplished by area bombing of Japan's cities and the often small and dispersed factories within them. Under Major General Curtis LeMay, the U.S. 20th Air Force, based in the Mariana Islands, undertook low-level incendiary bombing missions, results of which were soon measured in the number of square miles destroyed. The air raids on Japan had withered the nation's ability to continue fighting, although the Japanese government resisted every means to surrender, resulting the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.\n\n12,000 heavy bombers were shot down in World War 2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_website_desc;A submarine is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability. The term most commonly refers to a large, crewed, autonomous vessel. It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as "boats" rather than as "ships", regardless of their size.\n\nMilitary usage includes attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military), submarines, aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, and reconnaissance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
super_carrier_website_desc;"Supercarrier" is an unofficial descriptive term for the largest type of aircraft carrier, typically those displacing over 65,000 long tons. Supercarriers are the largest warships ever built, larger than the largest battleship class laid down by any country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tactical_bomber_website_desc;Tactical bombing is the aerial bombing aimed at targets of immediate military value, such as combatants, military installations, or equipment. This is in contrast to strategic bombing, attacking enemy cities and factories to debilitate the enemy's capacity to wage war, the enemy's future military production, as well as the enemy's civilians' will to continue the war. A tactical bomber is a bomber aircraft with an intended primary role of tactical bombing.\n\nTactical bombing is basically employed for two assignments: aircraft providing close air support attack targets in proximity to friendly ground forces, acting in direct support of the ground operations (as a "flying artillery"). Air interdiction attacks, by contrast, attack tactical targets that are not in contact with friendly units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

torpedo_boat_website_desc;A torpedo boat is a relatively small and fast naval vessel designed to carry torpedoes into battle. The first designs rammed enemy ships with explosive spar torpedoes, and later designs launched self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes. They were created to counter battleships and other large, slow and heavily armed ships by speed and agility. A number of inexpensive boats attacking en masse could overwhelm a larger ship's ability to fight them off using its large, slow-firing guns. This way an inexpensive fleet of torpedo boats could defend against much larger and more expensive fleets, albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
transport_plane_website_desc;Military transport aircraft or military cargo aircraft are typically fixed and rotary wing cargo aircraft which are used to deliver troops, weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the surface of the planet, usually outside of the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. Originally derived from bombers, military transport aircraft were used for delivering airborne forces during the Second World War and towing military gliders. Some military transport aircraft are tasked to performs multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and, tactical, operational and strategic airlifts onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
transport_ship_website_desc;This is the baseline naval transport ship within BlackICE. Historically, these were often converted cargo carriers, ocean liners and other passenger vessels that were employed for military use. While they are great for ferrying large amounts of troops and equipment from port to port, they have no amphibious capabilities! For amphibious operations, you'll need to build landing craft or assault ships;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
twin_engine_fighters_website_desc;A heavy fighter is a fighter aircraft designed to carry heavier weapons or operate at longer ranges. To achieve acceptable performance, most heavy fighters were twin-engined, and many had multi-place crews.\n\nThe twin-engine heavy fighter was a major design class during the pre-World War II period. Conceived as long-range escort fighters, or heavily armed bomber destroyers, heavy fighters largely failed in their intended roles during World War II, as they could not outmaneuver the more conventional, single-engined fighters. Many twin-engined heavy fighters eventually found their niche as night fighters, with considerable successes. Only the Northrop P-61 Black Widow of the USAAF was ever built from the start, during the World War II era, solely to be a night fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

usa_first_armor_website_desc;The 1st Armored Division - nicknamed "Old Ironsides" - is the only standing armored division of the United States Army, with its base of operations in Fort Bliss, Texas. It was the first armored division of the U.S. Army to see battle in World War II.\n\nThe division was nicknamed "Old Ironsides", by its first commander, Major General Bruce R. Magruder, after he saw a picture of the frigate USS Constitution, which is also nicknamed "Old Ironsides". The large "1" at the top represents the numerical designation of the division, and the insignia is used as a basis for most other sub-unit insignias. The cannon represents fire power, the track represents mobility, and the lighting bolt represents speed and shock force.\n\nThe three colors in the insignia, red, yellow, and blue represent the Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry Branches respectively, which are the colors of the three original combat arms which, when forged into one, created the field of Armor. This "pyramid of power" was devised by the order of then-Lieutenant Col. George S. Patton, Jr. in Bourg, France in early 1918 during Patton's formation and training of the Tank Corps in support of the American Expeditionary Force under General John J. Pershing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_second_armor_website_desc;The 2nd Armored Division ("Hell on Wheels") was an armored division of the United States Army. The division played an important role during World War II in the invasions of North Africa and Sicily and the liberation of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands and the invasion of Germany.\n\nThe 2nd Armored Division was formed at Fort Benning, Georgia on 15 July 1940. It was originally commanded by Major General Charles L. Scott, with Colonel George S. Patton in charge of training. Scott was promoted to command the I Armored Corps in November of that year, which put Patton, now a brigadier general, in command of the division. The division served with the First, Seventh, and Ninth Armies.\n\nThe 2nd Armored was organized as a "heavy" armored division, having two armored regiments of four medium tank and two light tank battalions of three companies each. Along with the 3rd Armored Division, it retained its organization throughout World War II. The 14 other U.S. armored divisions were reorganized as "light" armored divisions, having three tank battalions, each consisting of three medium tank companies and one light tank company. Both types had an infantry component of three mechanized battalions, although the heavy divisions maintained an "armored infantry regiment" organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_third_armor_website_desc;The 3rd Armored Division ("Spearhead") was an armored division of the United States Army. Unofficially nicknamed the "Third Herd", the division was first activated in 1941, and was active in the European Theater of World War II.\n\nThe Third Armored Division was organized as a "heavy" armored division, as was its counterpart, the 2nd Armored Division ("Hell on Wheels"). Later, higher-numbered U.S. armored divisions of World War II were smaller, with a higher ratio of armored infantry to tanks, based on lessons of the fighting in North Africa.\n\nAs a "heavy" division, the 3rd Armored possessed two armored regiments totaling four medium tank battalions and two of light tanks (18 companies) instead of three tank battalions containing both (12 companies), 232 medium tanks instead of the 168 allotted a light armored division, and with attached units numbered over 16,000 men, instead of the normal 12,000 found in the light armored divisions. Each division type had an infantry component of three mechanized infantry battalions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_eightysecond_airborne_website_desc;The 82nd Airborne Division is/was an active duty airborne infantry division of the United States Army, specializing in parachute assault operations into denied areas.\n\nThe 82nd Division was constituted in the National Army on 5 August 1917, and was organized on 25 August 1917, at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Since its initial members came from all 48 states, the unit acquired the nickname All-American, which is the basis for its famed "AA" shoulder patch.\n\nThe division participated in combat operations in Italy and Normandy during WW II, including Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_onehundredfirst_airborne_website_desc;During World War II, it was renowned for its role in Operation Overlord (the D-Day landings starting 6 June 1944, in Normandy, France), Operation Market Garden, the liberation of the Netherlands and action during the Battle of the Bulge around the city of Bastogne, Belgium.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_thirtysecond_id_light_website_desc;The 32nd Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army National Guard that fought primarily during World War I and World War II. It was formed with units from the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. With roots as the Iron Brigade in the American Civil War, the division's ancestral units came to be referred to as the Iron Jaw Division. During tough combat in France in World War I, it soon acquired from the French the nickname Les Terribles, referring to its fortitude in advancing over terrain previous units could not. It was the first allied division to pierce the German Hindenburg Line of defense, and the 32nd then adopted its shoulder patch; a line shot through with a red arrow, to signify its tenacity in piercing the enemy line. It then became known as the Red Arrow Division.\n\nDuring World War II, the division was credited with many "firsts". It was the first United States division to deploy as an entire unit overseas and among the first of seven U.S. Army and U.S. Marine units to engage in offensive ground combat operations during 1942. The division was among the first divisions to engage the enemy and were still fighting after the official Japanese surrender. The 32nd logged a total of 654 days of combat during World War II, more than any other United States Army division. The unit was inactivated in 1946 after occupation duty in Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_seventh_id_light_website_desc;The 7th Infantry Division was created during World War I, and was reactivated for WW2 on 1 July 1940. The division was centered around three infantry regiments - the 17th Infantry Regiment, the 32nd Infantry Regiment, and the 53rd Infantry Regiment. Also assigned to the division were the 31st, 48th, 49th and 57th Field Artillery Battalions, as well as the 7th Signal Company, the 707th Ordnance Company, the 7th Quartermaster Company, the 7th Reconnaissance Troop, the 13th Engineer Battalion, the 7th Medical Battalion, and the 7th Counter Intelligence Detachment. Most of the troops in the division were selective service soldiers, conscripted as a part of the US Army's first peacetime military draft.\n\nThe 7th Infantry Division converted to a "light infantry" division in 1942, and participated in several Pacific theatre campaigns, including the Aleutian and Marshall Islands, Leyte, and Okinawa. It also participated in the occupation of Japan after the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
usa_twentyfifth_id_website_desc; In 1921, the United States Army formed the Hawaiian Division to protect the islands and our growing interests in the Pacific region. On October 1, 1941, the Hawaiian Division was split to create the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions. The 25th Infantry Division was stationed at Schofield Barracks, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The Division was just over two months old when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor thrusting the United States into World War Two. After the attack, the Division moved into beach defensive positions, preparing to defend Honolulu from invasion.\n\nThe division continued in its role as protector of Oahu until November 1942, when they were ordered into action against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands. On November 25th the Division moved to Guadalcanal. The 25th Infantry Division took part in some of the bitterest fighting in the Pacific Theater. By February 5, 1943, organized enemy resistance had ended on Guadalcanal. A period of garrison duty followed until July. Due to their superior performance during the operation, the 25th Infantry Division earned its nickname: "Tropic Lightning.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
