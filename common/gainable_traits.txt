## BICE 8 Revised Trait System v 8.0.000 ##########################
###################################################################
# The ENTIRE Trait & Gainable_Trait System is Reworked for BICE 8 #
### Everything is completely rebalanced and much has been added ###
# DO NOT MESS WITH THE TRAITS FILES OR RIEVER WILL NERF-AXE YOU! ##
###################################################################
# SYNTAX - Provided by PI (paraphrased and grammatically corrected):
#
# Triggers use the combat event scope and are evaluated at the
# end of each combat for every suitable leader.
#
# hours_required is the exact number of hours required in such combat
# to gain the respective trait.
#
# Trigger province_temperature = X evaluates if the local temperature
# in combat is LOWER than X.
# To check for higher temperature use NOT = { province_temperature = X }
#
# has_combat_modifier values - case sensitive! Allowed options are:
#
# BM_DISSENT BM_LEADER_BONUS BM_DIFFICULTY BM_ENCIRCLEMENT_PENALTY
# BM_ENVELOPMENT_PENALTY BM_DIVISION_PENALTY BM_EXPERIENCE
# BM_MISSION_EFFICIENCY BM_DUGIN_MODIFIER
# BM_AMPH_PENALTY BM_FORT_MODIFIER BM_PARATROOP_PENALTY BM_RIVER_PENALTY
# BM_SHORE_BOMBARD BM_LACK_OF_SUPPLIES BM_MULTIPLE BM_COMBINED_ARMS
# BM_BASE_PROXIMITY BM_RADAR_STATION
# BM_INTERCEPT BM_AIRCOMBAT BM_TERRAIN BM_WEATHER BM_NIGHT_MODIFIER
# BM_SURPRISE_PENALTY BM_SURPRISE_BONUS BM_POOR_SCREEN_PENALTY
# BM_TERRITORIAL_PRIDE BM_RADIO
#
# Only 1 gainable_trait per specified trait type may be defined!

## BICE 8 Revised Trait System Introduction #######################
###################################################################
# OVERVIEW - if a trait seems like it should reasonably "work that way," it pretty much should now
# NOTE - this means that if a trigger seems like it should apply, it probably does now
# NOTE - and if a bonus effect seems like it should apply, it probably does as well
# NERF - some bonuses nerfed-down for game-balance, others nerfed-up for the same reason
##
# NOTE - Shorthand: Trait Level = TL, Friendly Leaders (with desired Trait) = Friendlies
##
# MECHANIC - 1) if another trait is a pre-requisite, any friendly general in your battle can provide it to all
# BONUS - well, the game does it, so you should know about it and use it, the AI does by mistake, lol
# MALUS - hours per TL are no longer identical, they increase, so no more mastery of 3 TLs at once
##
# MECHANIC - 2) hours for TL 1 are much more "per Trait-Level" than for subsequent TLs
# NOTE - hours to achieve TL 1 were equal or slightly more, but even that was not enough
# MALUS - TL 1 rewards the most of all Levels, but now takes many more hours to achieve
# NOTE - Result is better balance, since "already-traited" leaders get no hours "credited" for those TLs
##
# MECHANIC - 3) many traits, if appropriate, can be gained from Friendlies in same battle who have it
# BONUS - if you really want a certain general to have a certain trait? pair him in battles with one who does
# NOTE - idea for this occurred when reading how German generals watched Rommel in France and did this
# MALUS - this means that all traits that can gain from Friendlies now have increased hours... *nerf-bat*
# NOTE - the AI won't have to think about it, so it might finally gain some TLs in-game - oops! lol
##
# MECHANIC - 4) Gainable_Traits are CLASSed according to base hours: 750-Class, 1000-Class, etc.
# NOTE - LAND, SEA, AIR and MEDALS all have their own "Class System" as LISTed below
##
# LIST - LAND CLASS Categories - 750-Class, 1000-Class, 1500-Class, and 2500-Class
###################################################################
# NOTE - LAND 750-Class is so-named b/c it was setup 750/750/750, 1500-Class 1500/1500/1500, etc.
# NOTE - 750-Class translates to 750/1250/2000 "Standard," or to 1000/1750/2750 if it uses "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 1000-Class to 1000/1750/2750 "Standard," or to 1250/2250/3500 if it utilizes "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 1500-Class to 1250/2250/3500 "Standard," or to 1500/2500/4000 if it utilizes "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 2500-Class to 2000/3500/5000 "Standard," or to 2500/4000/6000 if it utilizes "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 600-Class is phased out, it now equals the 750-Class
# UPDATE - per MECHANIC 2, about 60% now added to TL1 and 20% to TL2
# UPDATE - 750-Class now is 1150/1500/2000 "Standard," or to 1600/2100/2750 if it uses "Friendlies"
# UPDATE - 1000-Class is 1600/2100/2750 "Standard," or to 2000/2700/3500 if it utilizes "Friendlies"
# UPDATE - 1500-Class is 2000/2700/3500 "Standard," or to 2650/3300/4000 if it utilizes "Friendlies"
# UPDATE - 2500-Class is 3300/4100/5000 "Standard," or to 3750/4800/6000 if it utilizes "Friendlies"
##
# LIST - SEA CLASS Categories include 500-Class, 375-Class, 275-Class, and 175-Class
###################################################################
# NOTE - 500-Class is so-named as it was originally setup 580/580/580, etc. etc.
# NOTE - SEA "Friendlies" are no where near as plentiful as LAND, so no need to tweak this for SEA
# NOTE - 500-Class is 500/675/875 currently for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 375-Class is 375/500/650 for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 275-Class is 275/375/500 for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 175-Class is 175/245/325 for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
##
# LIST - AIR CLASS Categories include 850-Class, 500-Class, 325-Class, and 200-Class
###################################################################
# NOTE - 500-Class was originally setup 500/1000/1500, etc. Most air traits were set to 500-Class
# NOTE - 850-Class is 850/1100/1400 for both "Standard" and "Friendlies" and replaces old 500-Class
# NOTE - 500-Class is 500/675/875 currently for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 325-Class is 325/425/550 for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
# NOTE - 200-Class is 200/275/375 for both "Standard" and "Friendlies"
