Air_Independent_Propulsion_desc;Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) is a term that encompasses technologies which allow a submarine to operate without the need to surface or rely on a snorkel to access atmospheric oxygen. The term usually excludes the use of nuclear power, and describes augmenting or replacing the traditional diesel-electric propulsion system of non-nuclear vessels. The United States Navy uses the hull classification symbol SSP to designate boats powered by AIP.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
night_fighters_specialised_armament;Night Fighter Specialised Armament;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
night_fighters_specialised_armament_desc;With the introduction of dedicated heavy machine-cannon coupled with innovative oblique firing installations, in German known as "Schräge Musik" or Oblique Music, by the end of 1942, night fighters were no longer simply heavy fighters equipped with a radar in the nose. Rather, they were specialised bomber-stalkers packing a powerful punch. No longer did the fighter have to approach the target bomber from the rear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
night_fighters_specialised_equipment;Night Fighter Specialised Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
night_fighters_specialised_equipment_desc;In order to continue the night fighter's advantage against bombers, more advanced radar and targeting systems were developed. At the forefront of such advanced targeting systems were the Germans with armament such as the SG500 Jägerfaust or the SG 116 'Zellendusche'. Both operated with photo-sensitive electric triggers to perfectly time the firing as the pilot flew under the shadow of the bomber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WWI_dogfights;Air Superiority Tactics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

super_heavy_tank_design;Super Heavy Armour Brigade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
super_heavy_tank_design_desc;By taking the concept of the heavy tank to its logical limit, we can develop super heavy tank brigades. These colossal tanks almost amount to mobile fortifications, and against almost all ground attacks their thick armour offers excellent protection. Moreover, their massive guns pose a threat to anything that opposes them. However, they are vastly expensive to build and operate and are still vulnerable to flanking tactics and air attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cavalry_motorization;Motorization of Cavalry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cavalry_motorization_desc;While most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns. A more correct term should be 'mounted infantry' instead of 'cavalry', as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation. However we can decide to make our cavalry more based on motorcycles and trucks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cavalry_mechanization;Armored Cavalry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cavalry_mechanization_desc;Since the development of armored warfare the distinction between light and heavy cavalry has persisted basically along historic lines. Cavalry units have adopted armored cars and light tanks in order to become a more capable reconnaissance force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

paramarine_activation_desc;The Imperial Japanese Navy fielded naval paratroopers during World War II. The troops were officially part of the Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF or Rikusentai).\nThe Paramarines (also known as Marine paratroopers) was a short-lived specialized unit of the United States Marine Corps, trained to be dropped by parachute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Jaeger_doctrine;Jaeger (improved scouting) doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Jaeger_doctrine_desc;Jäger is a term that was adopted in the Enlightenment Era in German-speaking states and others influenced by German military practice to describe a kind of light infantry. While it literally means 'hunter' in German, in military contexts Jäger may be regarded as meaning 'rifleman' or 'fighter' (in the same sense as 'fighter aircraft'). Certain infantry divisions were raised as 'light infantry divisions' (leichte Infanterie-Divisionen) in late 1940 or were renamed 'light divisions' (leichte Divisionen) in late 1941. They were raised to operate in rough terrain, especially in southeastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

battlecarrier_activation_desc;Following Japan's disastrous losses at the Battle of Midway  in which four of Japan's six fleet carriers were lost  the decision was made to convert unfinished Battleship hulls to Aircraft Carriers. The conversions began in June 1942. The conversion process placed a heavy emphasis on flight-deck armor, similar to the design of the British Illustrious-class aircraft carriers. You can now upgrade Battleships to Battlecarriers on the map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

rivetted_armour;Pre-War Armour Construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rivetted_armour_desc;Riveting was common for early armoured vehicles because welding large, thick plates was a skill in short supply. Riveting was relatively easy to carry out with unskilled labour and resulted in a strong join. The drawback of riveted armour became apparent in combat. \nWhen riveted armour is hit by a projectile the rivet heads tend to shear off and fly around the interior of the tank causing damage to the interior of the vehicle and injury to the occupants. This occurs even if the projectile is not powerful enough to penetrate the armour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

spaced_armour;Side Shields Armour Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spaced_armour_desc;Relatively thin armour plates or even metal mesh that is much lighter than fully protective armour. It can be attached as side skirts or turret skirts on tanks and other armoured vehicles. This light armour detonates the warhead prematurely so that the jet of molten metal is focused well before the main armour, becoming relatively ineffective to the main armour itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armor_plate_design;Advanced Armour Designs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armor_plate_design_desc;Armour design between AFVs varies greatly - a tank will normally be designed to take hits from other tank guns and anti-tank grenades, whilst light patrol vehicles are often only armoured "just in case". Whilst heavier armour provides better protection, it makes vehicles less mobile (for a given engine power), increases cost, uses more fuel and may limit the places it can go - for example, many bridges may be unable to support the weight of the heavy armour. The level of protection also usually varies considerably throughout the individual vehicle too, depending on the role of the vehicle and the likely direction of attack. For example, a tank will usually have the heaviest armour on the hull front and the turret, lighter armour on the sides of the hull and the thinnest armour on the top and bottom of the tank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
turrent_size;Three Man Turret;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
turrent_size_desc;The three-man turret allowed for each crew member to concentrate on one task (loading, aiming/firing and commanding, respectively).

wet_ammo_stowage;Wet Ammo Stowage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wet_ammo_stowage_desc; In tanks with wet ammunition stowage, main gun ammunition was stored in double-walled boxes. In between the walls of the ammunition boxes was a mixture of water, antifreeze, and an anticorrosive agent. \nWhen the boxes were penetrated, the water delayed or eliminated the resulting ammunition fire, giving crews valuable time to escape. More importantly, however, the ammunition was moved from the tank's sponson to under the turret, a much safer place for ammunition storage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Gasoline_engine;Gasoline Engine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Gasoline_engine_desc;A petrol engine (known as a gasoline engine in North America) is an internal combustion engine with spark-ignition, designed to run on petrol (gasoline) and similar volatile fuels. It differs from a diesel engine in the method of mixing the fuel and air, and in the fact that it uses spark-plugs to initiate the combustion process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Diver_CAS;Focus on Diver CAS;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Diver_CAS_desc;Diving nearly vertically at the target, in the same direction the bombs will take, the aircraft will release it's bombs very close to the target at high speed. This allows a dive bomber to accurately place bombs on relatively small and/or moving targets with relative ease. \nAdditionally, no complicated precision bombsight is needed for targeting. Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Tank_buster_rocket_tech_desc;The RP-3 (for Rocket Projectile 3 inch), was a British rocket used in the Second World War primarily as an air-to-ground weapon. It saw limited use in other roles. It's 60 lb (27 kg) warhead gave rise to the alternative name of the 60 lb rocket. They were generally used by British fighter-bomber aircraft against targets such as tanks, trains, motor-transport and buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hedgehog_dev;Hedgehog;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hedgehog_dev_desc;The Hedgehog (also known as an Anti-Submarine Projector) was an anti-submarine weapon developed during World War II, that was deployed on convoy escort warships such as destroyers to supplement the depth charge. The weapon worked by firing a number of small spigot mortar bombs from spiked fittings. Rather than working on a time or depth fuse like depth charges, the bombs exploded on contact and achieved a higher sinking-rate against submarines than depth charges did. The Hedgehog received its name because when unloaded, the rows of empty spigots resembled the spines of a hedgehog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jet_engine_dev;Jet Engine Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jet_engine_dev_desc;A jet engine is a reaction engine that discharges a fast moving jet of fluid to generate thrust in accordance with Newton's laws of motion. In common parlance, the term jet engine loosely refers to an internal combustion airbreathing jet engine (a duct engine). These typically consist of an engine with a rotary (rotating) air compressor powered by a turbine (Brayton cycle), with the leftover power providing thrust via a propelling nozzle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jet_fighter_activation;Jet Fighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jet_fighter_activation_desc;The first generation of jet fighters comprises the initial, subsonic jet fighter designs introduced late in World War II and in the early post-war period. They differed little from their piston-engined counterparts in appearance, and many employed unswept wings. Guns remained the principal armament. The impetus for the development of turbojet-powered aircraft was a decisive advantage in maximum speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jet_cas_activation;Jet Close Air Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jet_cas_activation_desc;With the advent of the guided missile, bombers had to turn to different ways to avoid interception. High speed and high altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Some designs could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. Surface to air missiles threatened high flying aircraft, and bombers moved to high speed low-level flight to get under air defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

he162_activation_desc;Heinkel's He 162 Volksjäger (People's Fighter, named after the Volkssturm) was a German single-engine, jet-powered fighter aircraft fielded by the Luftwaffe in World War II. Designed and built quickly, and made primarily of wood as metals were in very short supply and prioritised for other aircraft, the He 162 was nevertheless the fastest of the first generation of Axis and Allied jets. Volksjäger was the Reich Air Ministry's official name for the He 162.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

assault_rifles;Assault Rifles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assault_rifles_desc;The term assault rifle is a translation of the German word Sturmgewehr (literally "storm rifle", as in to "storm a position"). The name was coined by Adolf Hitler to describe the Maschinenpistole 43, subsequently renamed Sturmgewehr 44, the firearm generally considered the first assault rifle that served to popularise the concept and form the basis for today's modern assault rifle. The translation "assault rifle" gradually became the common term for similar firearms sharing the same technical definition as the StG 44. \nIn a strict definition, a firearm must have at least the following characteristics to be considered an assault rifle. It must be an individual weapon with provision to fire from the shoulder (i.e. a buttstock). It must be capable of selective fire. It must have an intermediate-power cartridge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

steel_casting_capability_desc;Steel casting is a manufacturing process by which molten steel is poured into a mold containing a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to cool and solidify. The solidified part is known as a "casting", which is ejected or broken-out of the mold to complete the process. \nCasting materials are usually metals or various cold-setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together. Examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_electro_welding_technology;Steel Electro Welding Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_electro_welding_technology_desc;1930 saw advances in the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and on into World War II. Many new welding methods were invented during this time, including Stud Welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged Arc Welding was invented in 1930, and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first Underwater Electric Arc Welding. Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and Gas Metal Arc Welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

transport_ship_activation_desc;Troop Ship Flotillas are the baseline naval transport ship within BlackICE.  Historically, these were often converted cargo carriers, ocean liners and other passenger vessels that were employed for military use. While they are great for ferrying large amounts of troops and equipment from port to port, they have no amphibious capabilities!  For amphibious operations, you'll need to build landing craft or assault ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

liberty_ship_activation_desc;Liberty ships were cargo ships built in the United States during World War II. Though British in conception, they were adapted by the U.S. as they were cheap and quick to build, and came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output. Based on vessels ordered by Britain to replace ships torpedoed by German U-boats, they were purchased for the U.S. fleet and for lend-lease deliveries of war materiel to Britain and to the Soviet Union via deliveries through Iran. Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Libertys between 1941 and 1945, easily the largest number of ships produced to a single design. While they are capable of carrying substantially more cargo as a normal transport ship, and benefit from having a slightly higher defence while at sea, they are not useful for amphibious operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

guard_heavy_armor_brigade_activation_desc;The Guards Heavy Tank Regiments were very different units from the tank brigades and tank corps, as well as the mechanized corps. These were units designed with operational objectives in mind. They were best used when inserted into a breach in the enemy lines and allowed to run free into the enemys rear area. There to raise hell and reach important distant objectives that would either force the enemy to withdraw a long way or to encircle him and prevent his ever being able to withdraw. \nThey were thus like a long handled crowbar inserted into a hole and using leverage rather than brute force to shift large chunks of enemy forces and territory. The Guards Heavy Tank Regiment was more like a short handled sledge hammer. Its job was short-ranged and its effect was tactical, to help smash open the hole for other forces to exploit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cavalry_pursuit_tactics;Cavalry Exploitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cavalry_pursuit_tactics_desc;Fast moving, light, mobile forces are used to exploit breakthroughs in the enemy lines. Traditionally light cavalry was used, but since WW1 these have been replaced by armored cars and light tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
attrition_warfare;Attritional Warfare;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
attrition_warfare_desc;Generally taken to mean the concept of fast annihilation of enemy forces is a tactical doctrine dating back to Frederick the Great. It emphasizes rapid, fluid movement to unbalance an enemy, allowing the attacker to impose his will upon the defender and avoid a stalemate. \nIt relies on uncommonly rigorous training and discipline and thoroughly professional leadership. Much of "Vernichtungsgedanke" (concept of annihilation) can be seen in Clausewitz classic treatise "Vom Kriege", written between 1816 and 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stormtrooper_tactics;Stormtrooper Tactics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stormtrooper_tactics_desc;In the last years of the war, "Stormtruppen" were trained to fight with infiltration tactics, part of the Germans' new method of attack on enemy trenches. Men trained in these methods were known in Germany as "Sturmmann", literally "Storm Man" but usually translated as "Stormtrooper". They were formed into companies of Sturmtruppen or "assault troops", more often and less exactly "Storm Troops". The infiltration tactics of the stormtroopers are still in use today in one form or another. Other armies have also used the term Assault Troops, Shock Troops or Fireteams for specialist soldiers who perform infiltration tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infiltration;Infiltration Tactics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infiltration_desc;Infiltration attacks began with brief and violent bombardments of the enemy front lines to suppress and demoralize the soldiers stationed there. The bombardment also targeted the enemy rear areas to destroy or disrupt roads, artillery, and command units. This was done to confuse the enemy, and reduce their capability to launch effective counterattacks from secondary defense lines. \nFor maximum effect, the exact points of attack remained concealed until the last possible moment. Light infantry led these attacks. They would attempt to penetrate enemy weak points to bypass and isolate heavily defended positions in the front line. Infantrymen with heavier weapons would then follow-up and have a great advantage when attacking the isolated enemy strong points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_barrage;Rolling artillery Barrages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_barrage_desc;The barrage was developed in World War I, and by late 1916 the creeping barrage was the standard means of using artillery to support an infantry attack, with the infantry following the advancing barrage as closely as possible. \nIts employment in this way recognised the importance of artillery fire in neutralising rather than destroying the enemy. It was found that a creeping barrage immediately followed by the infantry assault could be far more effective than weeks of preliminary bombardment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
banzai;Banzai Charges;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
banzai_desc;"Banzai" charge is the term used by Allied forces to refer to Japanese human wave attacks mounted by infantry units. This term came from the Japanese cry "Tenno Heika Banzai" (Long live the Emperor), shortened to "Banzai", it specifically refers to a tactic used by Japanese soldiers during the Pacific War. The banzai charge had some success at the end of a battle by assaulting the American soldiers that were unprepared for such type of attack. The banzai charge can be considered one of the least efficient strategies used in the Pacific War as shown by Japanese-to-American casualty ratios.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Auftragstaktik;Auftragstaktik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Auftragstaktik_desc;In mission-type tactics, the military commander gives their subordinate leaders a clearly defined goal (the mission), the forces needed to accomplish that goal, and a time frame within which the goal must be reached. The subordinate leaders then implement the order independently. The subordinate leader is given, to a large extent, the planning initiative and freedom in execution which allows a high-degree of flexibility at the operational and tactical levels of command. Mission-type Orders free the higher leadership from tactical details.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

elastic_defense;Elastic Defense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
elastic_defense_desc;In the last war we made great use of lines of trenches and fixed positions to stop the enemy. Now, by holding the front lines lightly, with reserves sent to stop the enemy when he has committed his troops, we can conduct a more efficient, elastic defence. This means our troops will be more likely to effect a tactical withdrawal when necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strongpoint_tactics;Hedgehog Defence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strongpoint_tactics_desc;In warfare the Hedgehog Defence is a military tactic for defending against a mobile armoured attack, or blitzkrieg. The defenders deploy in-depth in heavily fortified positions suitable for all-around defence. The attackers can penetrate between these "hedgehogs", but each position continues to fight-on when surrounded. This keeps large numbers of attacking troops tied up attacking the well-defended strongpoints. And allowing the defenders to successfully counterattack against the units that bypass these strongpoints with their own armored reserves by cutting them off from their supporting elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
defense_in_depth;Defense In Depth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
defense_in_depth_desc;Defence-in-depth requires that a defender deploy his resources such as fortifications, field works, and military units at and well behind the front line. Although an attacker may find it easier to breach the more-weakly defended front line, as he advances he continues to meet resistance. As he penetrates deeper, the attacker's flanks become vulnerable, and, should the advance stall, the attacker risks being enveloped. The defence-in-depth strategy is particularly effective against an attacker who is able to concentrate his forces and attack a small number of places on an extended defensive line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pakfront;PakFront Defenses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pakfront_desc;The use of multiple "Pakfronts", named for "PaK" (PanzerabwehrKanone,or "tank defense cannon") incorporates the use of minefields, anti-tank ditches, and other obstacles to channel the enemy armour into their fields of fire.

Such projects generally require at least R2000 MoneyW, R25000 SuppliesW and an optional amount of the other resources.\nRTo commit to a giant infrastructure project we will also have to choose the long term focus for our Industry!W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

milch_submarine_desc;This submarine was a support submarine with no torpedoes or deck guns other than anti-aircraft guns. The german version, type XIV was nicknamed Milchkuh/Milchkühe (milk cow).  Due to its large size, the Type XIV could resupply other boats with 400 tons of fuel, four torpedoes, and fresh food that was preserved in refrigerator units. In addition, the boats were equipped with bakeries, in order to provide the luxury of fresh bread for crews being resupplied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

panzerkreil;Panzerkeil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
panzerkreil_desc;At some point it became obvious for all sides of the war that to stop armored speatheads you need to concentrate your anti tank guns, come up with new tactics how to use them and train your troops to be able to properly utilize those tools. This triggered an ongoing race between new tactics designed to stop tanks and tactics like Panzerkeil, designed to break through even most packed with AT guns parts of enemy lines. This wedge shaped formation with heaviest tank at the front of it, and lighter tanks forming its wings is forcing enemy gunners to constantly adjust their ranges for each type of target. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
