EVTNAME33505;Japan decides desperate measures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33505;It seems our last advances against Japan have impressed their General Staff. The enemy is raising dozens of fresh divisions to protect its mainland. Invading Japan could became a nightmare, even though these troops are mostly ill-equipped and untrained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33509;2nd Shanghai Incident (August 9th, 1937) - Historical outcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33509;The 2nd Shanghai incident, also known as the Battle of Shanghai was the first major engagement fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war. On August 9th, an incident at the Hongqiao Airport heightened the tensions between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the Shanghai International Settlement. Japan began sending in reinforcements to Shanghai asking for a total withdrawal of Chinese forces in the area.\n A fierce three-month battle ensued, involving more than 70 divisions (700,000 men) on the Chinese side facing 9 Japanese divisions supported by planes, tanks, heavy artillery and ships from the 3rd Fleet, totalling 300,000 men. Japan made amphibious landings on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay to support its isolated garrison in Shanghai.\nThe Chinese soldiers had to rely primarily on small-caliber weapons in their defense of Shanghai, against an overwhelming Japanese onslaught of air, naval, and armored striking power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, while also failing to elicit any international intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33510;Battle of Shanghai is raging...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

For example, artillery regiments consisted of only 12 75mm field guns and Type 91 10 cm howitzers.\n\nThe 129th Division ('Dai-hyakunijukyu Shidan', nicknamed 'Shinbu Heidan') was formed in Daya Bay (Guangdong) from parts of the 19th Independent Mixed Brigade and was expected to counter an Allied attack on Hong Kong.\nThe 130th Division ('Dai-hyakusanju Shidan', nicknamed 'Shoki Heidan') was also formed in Daya Bay from parts of the 19th IMB, like its sister division, the 129th. It was garrisoning Zhongshan and Shantou.\nThe 161st Division ('Dai-hyakurokujuichi Shidan', nicknamed 'Shinten Heidan', meaning 'Skyquake Division') was formed in Shanghai and tasked to perform coastal defense duties in Shanghai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33632;Formation of new Coastal Divisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33632;On May 23 1945 another 10 Costal Defense Divisions were raised: the 303th, 308th, 312th, 316th, 320th, 321st, 322nd, 350th, 354th and 355th Divisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33633;Formation of Mobile Reserve Divisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33633;Alongside Coastal Divisions 7 mobile reserve units were raised - the 221st, 222nd, 224th, 225th, 229th, 231th, and 234th Divisions - only made up of understrength and poorly equipped infantry regiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33634;Last Japanese divisions formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33634;On July 10 1945, a last batch of 8 divisions were created simultaneously to protect Manchukuo against the Soviet Union. Most of them were in fact a regrouping of already existing smaller units, without adequate manpower, armaments or even supplies.\nThe 134th Division ('Dai-hyakusanjuyon Shidan', nicknamed 'Magatama Heidan', meaning 'Jewel Division') was formed in Jiamusi from the 14th Border Guards Group, Fujin garrison and the 78th Independent Mixed Brigade.\nThe 135th Division ('Dai-hyakusanjugo Shidan', nicknamed 'Shinshin Heidan', meaning 'Cordiality Division') was formed in Mishan from Border Guards groups.\nThe 136th Division ('Dai-hyakusanjuroku Shidan', nicknamed 'Fubatsu Heidan', meaning 'Invincible Division') was formed in Benxi from the same units as the 135th Division.\nThe 137th Division ('Dai-hyakusanjunana Shidan', nicknamed 'Fuyoku Division') was formed in North Hamgyong Province from small parts detached from the 79th division.\nThe 138th Division ('Dai-hyakusanjuhachi Shidan', nicknamed 'Fudo Heidan', meaning 'Immovable Division') was formed in several towns along the Jilin - Shenyang railroad.\nThe 139th Division ('Dai-hyakusanjukyu Shidan', nicknamed 'Fukutsu Heidan', meaning 'Formidable Division') was formed in Dunhua from transport guard units.\nThe 148th Division ('Dai-hyakuyonjuhachi Shidan', nicknamed 'Fugaku Division') was formed in Changchun from the city's garrison.\nThe 149th Division ('Dai-hyakuyonjukyu Shidan', nicknamed 'Fugyo Heidan', meaning 'Inflexible Division') was formed in Qiqihar from troops taken from the 125th Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33635;Formation of 1st and 2nd Tank Divisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33635;The 1st Tank Division ('Sensha Dai-ichi Shidan', nicknamed 'Taku' meaning 'Expand') was created on June 24 1942 out of 4 separate armored regiments based in Manchukuo and got the status of a full armored division with the addition of infantry and artillery regiments. \nUnder the command of Lieutenant General Toshimoto Hoshino, the 1st Tank Division was tasked primarily with border patrol of Manchukuo's eastern frontier with the Soviet Union but its regiments were reassigned to other fronts: the 9th Armored Regiment to Saipan, and the remaining three participated in Operation Ichi-Go in mainland China. In March 1945, the 1st Tank Division with its 5th Armored Regiment was reassigned to the Japanese home islands in preparation for the expected invasion by Allied forces.\n\nThe 2nd Tank Division ('Sensha Dai-ni Shidan', nicknamed 'Geki', meaning 'Attack') was raised in Manchukuo on June 24 1942 and was stationed in Mudanjiang, under the command of Lieutenant General Tasuku Okada.\nLike the 1st Tank Division, its initial mission was border patrol of Manchukuo's frontier with the Soviet Union but its forces were sent to various locations: 11th Tank Regiment was sent to the Kurils and assigned to 91st Division, its recon unit and anti-aircraft guns were directed to China. The remaining units of the division were reassigned to the Japanese 14th Area Army, and sent to the Philippines in August 1944. They were almost destroyed in the Battle of Luzon. The 2nd Tank Division was reconstituted in Japan as a training unit after the disaster in the Philippines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33636;Formation of 3rd Tank Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33636;The 3rd Tank Division ('Sensha Dai-san Shidan', nicknamed 'Taki', meaning 'Torrent'), was raised in Inner Mongolia in 1942 as part of the Japanese Northern China Area Army. Its first two commanders were Lieutenant General Isaku Nishihara (until January 1944) and Lieutenant General Hideo Yamaji.\nThe 3rd Tank Division participated in Operation Ichi-Go in China (1944) and thereafter, its tank regiments were assigned to many different locations: the 8th Armored Regiment was sent to Rabaul, the 12th Armored Regiment was withdrawn to bolster the defenses of Seoul, the 13th Armored Regiment was withdrawn to Tianjin in 1944, and ended the war in Changsha. The 17th Armored Regiment ended the war in Tianjin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33637;Formation of 4th Tank Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33637;The 4th Tank Division ('Sensha Dai-yon Shidan', nicknamed 'Hagane', meaning 'Steel') was the 4th and last armored division raised by Japan during the war. It was set up on July 6 1944 in Chiba, near Tokyo. The division was assigned to 36th Army Corps, and placed under the command of Lieutenant General Shiori Nagura.\nSimilar to the German Panzer-Lehr-Division, it was created out of the training departments of the Armor School, Cavalry School, Field Artillery School and Military Engineering School of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, its remaining students and staff. The 4th Tank Division was equipped with the finest and most advanced armaments, including a significant number of Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tanks and Type 3 Ho-Ni III tank destroyers. Nevertheless, the division lacked both infantry and self-propelled gun regiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33638;Formation of SNLF brigades in 1937;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33638;Following the escalation of hostilities in Shanghai in August 1937, the Navy organized additional SNLF battalions, which were often raised for a specific task and then disbanded.\nIn addition to the Shanghai SNLF, three other SNLF units from this period remained active throughout the war. These were the Sasebo 8th SNLF, Yokosuka 4th SNLF and Maizuru 1st SNLF. These three SNLF units were large but relatively lightly armed, and they remained on Hainan on garrison duty throughout the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33639;Formation of Independent Mixed Brigades for garrison duties in China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33639;In February 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army decided to raise brigades for garrison duties in China: the 1st and 2nd Independent Mixed Brigades ('Dokuritsu Konsei Ryodan') were reformed alongside the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Infantry Mixed Brigades ('Hohei Konsei Ryodan'). These brigades were later used to form division-sized units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33640;Formation of Border Garrisons in Manchukuo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33640;In March 1939, Border garrisons ('Kokkyo Shubitai') units were formed in Manchukuo to protect the border with the Soviet Union. These units were a mix of infantry, artillery and recon cavalry battalions. 5 more were ordered in 1940.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33641;Formation of Karafuto Independent Mixed Brigade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33641;The Karafuto Independent Mixed Brigade was formed in Toyohara, south Sakhalin Island, in September 1939, upon regiments of the 7th Division. In February 1945, this brigade formed the nucleus of the 88th Infantry Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33642;New brigades for garrison duties in China;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33642;In November 1939, Japan raised another 10 IMBs for garrison duties in China. You will receive the 11th and 18th Independent Mixed Brigades but you'll have to build the other brigades by yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33643;New Border Garrisons for Manchukuo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33643;5 new garrison divisions were raised in Manchukuo in March 1940 and were attached to the 4th, 5th and 20th Armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33644;Form the South Seas Detachment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33644;The South Seas Detachment ('Nankai Shitai') was a brigade-size force of the Imperial Japanese Army designed in 1941 to seize Wake, Guam and the Gilberts. As part of the South Seas Force, it fell under the command of the Imperial Japanese Navy. It later rejoined the 55th Division for the New Guinea Campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33645;Send support brigades for Kwantung army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33645;From July 11th to August 8th, no less than 17 artillery regiments, 17 anti-aircraft regiments, 5 anti-tank battalions and 2 tank regiments were sent to Manchuria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33646;Tauran Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33646;The Tauran Incident was a border clash between the Soviet Union and Japan and their respective puppet states of Mongolia and Manchukuo that happened in March 1936.\nA force of 100 Mongol soldiers with 6 Soviet advisors took control of the contested village of Tauran on March 11th. The Imperial Japanese Army mounted a successful counterattack, supported by light tanks, armored cars and warplanes, that overwelmed the Mongol defenders who were forced to retreat, suffering 59 killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33647;Manchurian Cavalry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33647;The Manchukuo Imperial Army, the armed forces of the Empire of Great Manchukuo made large use of cavalry brigades for border and local security duties.\nA typical Manchurian cavalry brigade was composed of a headquarters, three cavalry regiments, and an artillery company, for a total of 1,500 men and 1,500 horses.\n\n§RHere you can receive a whole Manchurian Cavalry Corps as an expeditionnary force.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33648;Tensions with China;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33648;In 1937, the Imperial General Staff started to move troops to reinforce the North China army for an upcoming confrontation with China.\nThe 20th Infantry Division was called up from Korea, the 2nd Independent Mixed Brigade from the Kwantung Army and the 5th, 6th and 10th Infantry Divisions from the Japanese mainland. This was also including the 1st Tank Regiment (Colonel Baba) and the 2nd Tank Regiment (Colonel Imada) from Kurume and Chiba.\n\n§RNote for player: You'll have to ship troops manually to Manchuria.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33649;Kanchazu Island Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33649;The Kanchazu Island Incident took place in late June 1937 between Japanese and Soviet forces on the Amur river. Soviet forces from the Amur Flotilla started to unload troops on Kanchazu Island located in the center of the river, crossing the official frontier between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union. Japan reacted quickly and mounted a counterattack with its 1st Infantry Division. The 49th Infantry regiment led by Colonel Mihara Kanae inflicted substantial losses, including the destruction of a Type 1124 BKA gunboat, by a combination of machinegun and 37mm AT gunfire. Soviet forces were forced to withdraw and on June 29th, Japanese ambassador Shigemistu Mamoru met foreign minister Maxim Litvinov who accepted that the island would remain Manchurian. Apparently, the Soviets were more concerned with events unfolding in Northern China and Europe, as well as internal strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33650;Yellow River Flood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33650;The 1938 Yellow River Flood was a flood created by the Nationalist Government in Central China in an attempt to slow down the Japanese advance in China. Dykes on the Yellow river were opened near Huayuankou in early June 1938 and floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of farmland. Casualties were heavy, with 400,000 to 500,000 dead and 3 million refugees. The strategic value of the flood has been questioned as it failed to stop the Japanese advance towards Wuhan. It also produced a long term psychological effect on the Chinese population: large parts of the people held the KMT responsible and switched alleigiance to the Japanese or the Communists.\n\n§RNote for player: due to the flooding, the infrastructure in the area southeast of Zhengzhou will be heavily damaged and much harder to attack due to the mud and destruction for 4 months, the coal mines present there will also be operating at a greatly reduced rate.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33652;Japan starts to reinforce the Kwantung Army after Barbarossa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33652;In July 1941, the war between Germany and the Soviet Union pushed the Japanese High Command to start reinforcing the Kwantung Army. A weakened Soviet Union could be an interesting target.\nJapanese forces in the area were enlarged from 400,000 to 700,000 men with new units - the 3rd Cavalry Division, 51st and 57th Infantry Divisions  and new tank and artillery brigades to strengthen already existing units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33653;Protect our country from air raids;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33653;After the Doolittle air raid in April 1942, Japan started being concerned about Allied bombing raids. Japanese mainland AA units were equipped with around 150 anti-aircraft guns, most of which were obsolete, and its personnel were poorly trained. In November 1942, a significant effort began to reach a total of 20 AA regiments.\n\n§RIt's up to you to decide if you need some more anti-aircraft units.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33654;Japanese 'Cleanup Trio';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33654;The Tainan Naval Air Group ('Tainan Kaigun Kokutai') was an elite fighter unit of the Imperial Japanese Navy that spawned more aces than any other Japanese unit during WW2. It was deployed in March 1942 to Rabaul (New Britain) and Lae (New Guinea) as a part of the IJN's 11th Air Fleet. The Tainan Naval Air Group fought in the New Guinea and Guadalcanal campaigns, destroying many Allied aircraft. This unit was well known by Allied forces who rapidly identified three Japanese aces as the 'Cleanup Trio':\n\nHiroyoshi Nishizawa, aka the 'Demon of Rabaul', Toshio Ota and Saburo Sakai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33655;Yamamoto's inspection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33655;In April 1943, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy, scheduled an inspection tour of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. He planned to inspect Japanese air units participating in Operation I-Go that had begun on April 7. In addition, the tour would boost Japanese morale following the disastrous Guadalcanal Campaign and its subsequent evacuation during January and February. Staff officers made several warnings about the risks being taken by the IJN commander-in-chief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33656;Yamamoto's inspection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33656;In April 1943, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy, scheduled an inspection tour of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. He planned to inspect Japanese air units participating in Operation I-Go that had begun on April 7. In addition, the tour would boost Japanese morale following the disastrous Guadalcanal Campaign and its subsequent evacuation during January and February.\nUS intelligence and Navy cryptographers deciphered Japanese communications and discovered that Yamamoto will personally fly to Bougainville. American high command took this opportunity to get rid of Admiral Yamamoto and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz ordered an interception that would be called 'Operation Vengeance'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33657;Yamamoto's flight to Balalae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33657;Admiral Yamamoto decided to begin his tour flying with his staff in 2 medium bombers covered by 6 navy fighters from Rabaul to Balalae Airfield, on a island near Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. Departure was scheduled on April 18 1943 at 6:00, ignoring the warnings of officiers who thought that this kind of frontline flight was too risky.\nYamamoto also ignored warnings that US military intelligence had intercepted and decrypted Japanese communications in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33658;Yamamoto has been shot down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33658;10 minutes before landing at Balalae, Admiral Yamamotos flight was ambushed by American P-38s. His aircraft  a G4M 'Betty' - was shot down and crashed in the jungle, 14 km from the town of Panguna. Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki escaped death by crash-landing in the water. A total of 19 Japanese pilots and officers were killed during the ambush.\nThe Japanese public were told about Yamamotos death nearly one month later and his ashes returned to Japan at Kisarazu aboard the battleship Musashi on May 23rd, 1943.\n\nThe 'Navy ko incident' - the Japanese name for Yamamotos killing   delivered a severe blow to Japanese morale and organization and a certain boost to the USAs ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33659;Yamamoto has been shot down!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33659;Led by Captain Thomas G. Lanphier Jr, 18 P-38s took off on April 18 1943 from Kukum Field on Guadalcanal and made an indirect approach to avoid Japanese detection. At 9:34, the American fighters met Yamamotos flight and shot down his G4M 'Betty.' Part of Yamomotos staff on board a second bomber  including Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki  escaped death by crash-landing in the water.\nControversy began later about who shot down the Admirals aircraft as both Captain Lanphier and Lieutnant Rex T. Barber claimed the kill.\n\nOperation Vengeance delivered a severe blow to Japanese morale and organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33660;Formation of PETA;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33660;PETA  'Pembela Tanah Air' or 'Defenders of the Homeland' - was an Indonesian volunteer militia raised by Japan in late 1943 to protect occupied Indonesia from possible Allied landings. Up to 69 battalions were raised, mostly in Java (37,000 men) and Sumatra (20,000 men). This force was disbanded on August 17 1945 by Japanese order..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33661;The Shanghai Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33661;The Shanghai Incident, also called the January 28 incident, was a conflict between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China that happened in 1932.\nJapanese aggression in China provoked anti-Japanese demonstrations in Shanghai, including the beating and killing of a buddhist monk. Japanese navy and army forces reacted and the conflict escalated into heavy fighting, involving more than 100,000 men, 80 ships and 300 planes facing 50,000 Chinese soldiers of 5th Army and 19th Route Army.\nOn May 5, China and Japan signed the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement that made Shanghai a demilitarized zone and forbade China to garrison troops while allowing the presence of a few Japanese units in the city. China was allowed to keep only a small police force within the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33662;Imperial Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33662;The Imperial Guard of the Imperial Japanese Army was formed in 1867. Organized and trained along French military lines, the Imperial Guard soon mustered 12,000 men in 2 brigades of 2 regiments each. It was based in Tokyo and recruited nationally. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, a second Guards Brigade was formed from indigenous Formosans.\nIn 1920 the Guards Cavalry Regiment, Guards Field Artillery Regiment, Guards Engineer Battalion, Guards Transport Battalion, plus other Guards support units were added.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33663;Imperial Guard Expansion (1939);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33663;From 1937 to 1939 the Guards Engineer Battalion was expanded into a regiment as was the Guards Transport Battalion. In September 1939, the Division staying in Tokyo was split into the 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades, while the Formosa Mixed Brigade was sent as reinforcements to the IJA 11th Army in Central China. It was later used to form the 48th Infantry Division.\nThe 1st Guards Brigade, which contained the 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Regiments, the cavalry regiment, and half of the support units, was transferred to South China. Here it became known as the Mixed Guards Brigade. In October 1940, it joined other Japanese units occupying French Indochina.\nThe 2nd Guards Brigade, which contained the 3rd and 4th Guards Regiments, also went to China. In 1940, it went to Shanghai before being posted to Hainan Island. In June 1941, the 5th Guards Infantry Regiment joined the 2nd Guards Brigade becoming the Imperial Guard Division.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33664;Imperial Guard Expansion (1943);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33664;In May 1943, all designated Imperial Guard units were renamed again.\nThe Mixed Guards Brigade in Tokyo became the 1st Guards Division ('Konoe Dai-ichi Shidan') which now consisted of the 1st, 2nd and 6th Guards Regiments, with the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment, 1st Guards Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Guards Engineer Regiment and 1st Guards Transport Regiment, and other support units. Based in Tokyo, it remained in Japan until the end of war.\nThe Imperial Guard Division became the 2nd Guards Division ('Konoe Dai-ni Shidan'). Its composition wasn't altered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33665;Imperial Guard Expansion (1944);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33665;The 3rd Guards Division ('Konoe Dai-san Shidan') was formed in 1944. It consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Regiments and stayed in Japan to defend the homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33666;Formation of 109th Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33666;The 109th Division ('Dai-hyakukyu Shidan', nicknamed 'Tan Heidan', meaning 'Courage Division') was reformed in May 1944 from the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade and other Bonin Islands garrisons reinforced by recruits from the Kofu Mobilization District. The 109th Division was made as a Type-A Division (Reinforced) because it had two infantry brigades (5000 men each) with two infantry regiments each. It was assigned to the 31st Army, garrisoned on the volcanic islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima. The 109th Division, under the command of Lieutenant-General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, was wiped out by American forces from February to March 1945 in the Battle of Iwo Jima.\n\n§RNote for player: Although the 109th Division was separated into 2 brigades, you will receive it as a full unit in Kanazawa§B.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33667;Formation of IJN 11th Air Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33667;The Japanese 11th Air Fleet ('Dai-Juichi Koku Kantai') was a grouping of naval aviation and surface units from the Imperial Japanese Navy. It consisted of land-based bombers, fighters, flying boats and seaplane tenders. 11th Air Fleet was created on January 15 1941, placed under the command of the Combined Fleet and the Southern Area Fleet after December 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33668;Japanese engineering vehicle 'SS-Ki';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33668;The Soko Sagyo Ki ('armoured work vehicle'), also known as the SS-Ki, was a tracked engineering vehicle introduced in 1931 and designed to destroy Soviet fortified positions along the Manchurian border. In fact, it became a multirole armored vehicle: trench digging, mine clearing, barbed wire cutting, mass decontamination, chemical weapons employment, use as a crane vehicle, a bridgelayer or as a flamethrower tank.\nThe first four SS-Ki were assigned to the 1st Mixed Tank Brigade sent to China. During the Battle of BeipingTianjin in 1937, the vehicles were used as flamethrower tanks. SS-Ki were sent to Japanese engineer brigades and armored divisions, notably in the 2nd Tank Division transferred to the Philippines in late 1941.\n\n§RNote for player: this event will give you faster access to the armored engineer technology§B.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
