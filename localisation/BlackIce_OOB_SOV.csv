EVTDESC49015;The first T-35s formed the 5th Separate Heavy Tank Brigade in Moscow, and paraded on May, 1st, 1936 on the Red Square. They apparently did not participate in the border wars in Mongolia, the invasion of Poland or the Winter War. By June 1940, they were seen as nearly obsolete and costly to operate, and the question was raised of their demobilization, conversion, or assignation to military academies. They were eventually transferred to the 8th Mechanized Corp in the Kiev district (Ukraine), into the 67th and 68th Tank Regiments of the 34th Tank Division. In the summer of 1941, 90% of these tanks were lost due to mechanical breakdowns, lack of maintenance, fuel, and #often sabotaged by their crews abandoning them. These figures can be explained by its sheer size and the fact it was overweight for its engine and transmission (similar to the T-28). A few surviving vehicles were recorded during the battle of Moscow during the winter 1941-42.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC92090; The first three Air Armies, designated 'Air Armies of Special Purpose' were created between 1936 and 1938. 1st was created in 1 march 1936, 2nd Air Army was created on 15 March 1937 in the Far East. Somewhat later, the 3rd Air Army was created in the North Caucasus Military District. However, air armies were excluded from the organisational reform of the air forces approved on 25 July 1940. On 5 November 1940, the three existing air armies were reformed as the long range bombardment aviation of the Stavka of the Red Army due to poor combat performance during the conflict with Finland.\nYou can manually attach this Command to the Moscow MD theatre, as this is the closest to the Stavka.\n\nFrom May - November 1942, seventeen Air Armies were created from the air forces of the Fronts and Combined Arms Armies, and in December 1944 a long-range aviation Air Army was created as the 18th Air Army.[2] The 1st Air Army was the first created, on 5 May 1942, as part of the Western Front. The next to form during 1942 were the 2nd, 3rd, 4th (22 May 1942), 5th, 6th 8th Air Armies (June 1942), 9th/10th/11th/12th (Aug 1942), 7th and 13th Air Army (November 1942), 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th Air Armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
