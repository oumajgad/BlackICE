Operation_Market_Garden_desc;Operation Market Garden was an Allied military operation fought in the Netherlands and Germany between September 17th and the 25th, 1944. It was the largest airborne operation of all time. The operation plan's strategic context required the seizure of bridges across the Maas (Meuse River) and two arms of the Rhine (the Waal and the Lower Rhine) as well as several smaller canals and tributaries. \nCrossing the Lower Rhine would allow the Allies to outflank the Siegfried Line and encircle the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. It made large-scale use of airborne forces whose tactical objectives were to secure a series of bridges over the main rivers of  German-occupied Netherlands and allow a rapid advance by armoured units into Northern Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

zDD_Battle_of_Stalingrad_desc;The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad. The battle took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as one of the turning points of the war. \nThe battle was the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million. The battle involved more participants than any other, and was marked by brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive — which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city — was the first substantial German land defeat of World War II. The battle was arguably the most important turning point in not only the Eastern Front, but the War itself, as it marked the beginning of the Soviet counter-offensive that greatly contributed to the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany around two and a half years later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The other mechanized divisions capable of intervening in Normandy were retained under the direct control of the German Armed Forces HQ (OKW) and were initially denied to Rommel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

Volkssturm_doctrine_decision_desc;In order for these militia units to be effective, Hitler and Bormann counted not only on strength in numbers, but also in fanaticism. During the early stages of Volkssturm planning, it became apparent that if militia units lacked morale they would lack combat effectiveness. To achieve the envisioned fanaticism, Volkssturm units were placed under direct command of the local Nazi party, meaning local Gau- and Kreisleiters. \nThe new Volkssturm was also to become a nationwide organization, with Heinrich Himmler as Replacement Army Commander, responsible for armament and training.  Though normally under party control, Volkssturm units were placed under Wehrmacht command when engaging in action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

pearl_harbor_decision_title;Operation Z - Attack of Pearl Harbour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pearl_harbor_decision_desc;Aircraft and midget submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy began an attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii.  Contrary to popular belief, these attacks were not a surprise. The Americans had deciphered Japan's code earlier and knew about a planned attack before it actually occurred. However, due to difficulty in deciphering intercepted messages, the Americans failed to discover Japan's target before the attack occurred. \nUnder the command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the attack was devastating in loss of life and damage to the U.S. fleet. At 6:05 a.m. on December 7, the six Japanese carriers launched a first wave of 183 planes composed mainly of dive bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters. The Japanese hit American ships and military installations at 7:51 a.m. The first wave attacked military airfields on Ford Island. At 8:30 a.m. a second wave of 170 Japanese planes, mostly torpedo bombers, attacked the fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
kamikaze_decision_title;'Kamikaze Tactics' Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kamikaze_decision_desc;[This decision activates the 'Kamikaze' tech] Although Kamikaze was the most common and best-known form of Japanese suicide attack during World War II, they were similar to the Banzai charge used by Japanese soldiers. The main difference between the two is that suicide is essential to the success of a Kamikaze attack, whereas a Banzai charge is only potentially suicidal, that is, the attackers hope to survive but do not expect to. The tradition of suicide instead of defeat, capture and perceived shame was deeply entrenched in the Japanese military culture. It was one of the main traditions in the samurai life and the Bushido code: loyalty and honour until death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

lend_lease_decision_desc;Lend-Lease was the name of the program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations with vast amounts of war material between 1941 and 1945. It began in March 1941, over 18 months after the outbreak of the war in September 1939. It was called An Act Further to Promote the Defense of the United States. This act also ended the pretense of the neutrality of the United States. Hitler recognized this and consequently had his submarines attack US ships such as the SS Robin Moor, a 5,000 ton unarmed merchant steamship destroyed by a German U-boat on 21 May, 1941 outside of the war zone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

operation_torch_decision_desc;Operation Torch was the British-American invasion of French North Africa in World War II starting the North African Campaign, 8 November 1942.

An attack on French North Africa was proposed instead, which would clear the Axis Powers from North Africa," improve naval control of the Mediterranean Sea and prepare for an invasion of the "Soft Underbelly" of Southern Europe in 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,

Soviet_Polish_war_title;Soviet Invasion of Poland ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Soviet_Polish_war_desc;Hitler's troops were already wreaking havoc in Poland, having invaded on the first of September 1939. The Polish army began retreating east and regrouping near Lvov, in eastern Galicia, attempting to escape the relentless German land and air offensives. But Polish troops had jumped from the frying pan into the fire, as Soviet troops began occupying eastern Poland. \nThe Ribbentrop-Molotov Non-Aggression Pact, signed in August, had eliminated any hope Poland had of a Russian ally in a war against Germany. Little did Poles know that a secret clause of that pact, the details of which would not become public until 1990," gave the U.S.S.R. the right to mark off for itself a chunk of Poland's eastern region. The "reason" given was that Russia had to come to the aid of its "blood brothers", the Ukrainians and Byelorussians who were trapped in territory that had been illegally annexed by Poland. Now Poland was squeezed from West and East—trapped between two behemoths.\nIts forces overwhelmed by a mechanized modern German army, Poland had nothing left with which to fight the Soviets. As Soviet troops broke into Poland, they unexpectedly met up with German troops who had fought their way that far east in a little more than two weeks. The Germans receded when confronted by the Soviets, handing over their Polish prisoners of war. Thousands of Polish troops were taken into captivity, some Poles simply surrendered to the Soviets to avoid being captured by the Germans. The Soviet Union would wind up with about three-fifths of Poland and 13 million of it's people as a result of the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,

Soviet_rail_construction_title;Change the Soviet Rail Guauge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Soviet_rail_construction_desc;Without a doubt, the German railway transportation system played a far more strategic role on the eastern front than it did in any other German theater of war. With the exception of the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and areas in close proximity to larger Soviet urban or industrial/production centers, the rail and ground transportation network of the Soviet Union was in a more primitive state of existence when compared to western Europe or the United States. German military railroad planners made one critical error in their Barbarossa calculations - they did not take the primitiveness of the Soviet interior into account when planning for their attack. This would cost the Germans dearly later. In the west, the problems encountered were minimal. All of the defeated nations used standard gauge rail lines. With little effort, these new networks were amalgamated into the German system. Only Spain used wide gauge lines, but as long as Spain remained a neutral, this really did not affect the German military situation any. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

This offensive was also referred to in Germany as the Plattensee Offensive, in Soviet Union as the Balaton Defensive Operation (6 – 15 March 1945), and in English as the Lake Balaton Offensive. The offensive begun by the Germans in great secrecy on 6 March 1945. They launched attacks in Hungary near the Lake Balaton area. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the failed Ardennes Offensive on the Western Front, including the 6th SS Panzer Army and the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH).

USA_nukes_Hiroshima_desc;The White House and War Department announced today that an atomic bomb, possessing more power than 20,000 tons of TNT, a destructive force equal to the load of 2,000 B-29's and more than 2,000 times the blast power of what previously was the world's most devastating bomb, had been dropped on Japan.\n    The announcement, first given to the world in utmost solemnity by President Truman, made it plain that one of the scientific landmarks of the century had been passed, and that the "age of atomic energy," which can be a tremendous force for the advancement of civilization as well as for destruction, was at hand.\n    At 10:45 o'clock this morning, a statement by the President was issued at the White House that sixteen hours earlier- about the time that citizens on the Eastern seaboard were sitting down to their Sunday suppers- an American plane had dropped the single atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, an important army center.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The target today was an important industrial and shipping area with a population of about 258,000.\n    The great bomb, which harnesses the power of the universe to destroy the enemy by concussion, blast and fire, was dropped on the second enemy city about seven hours after the Japanese had received a political "roundhouse punch" in the form of a declaration of war by the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
