EVTNAME33401;Deploy the 7a Divisione CC. NN. "Cirene" in Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33401;The Blackshirt division Cirene was created in April 1936 to be sent to Abyssinia. It was the seventh division sized unit raised by the MSVN to conduct military operations. The division was above 14,000 men in strength, including 8 regiments of 'Camicie Nere' and various support units. Its commander was General Guido Scandolara, a mountain fighter and highly decorated officer of the Great War. It never actually deployed to Abyssinia; instead the division was kept in reserve in Libya in the event of a conflict with the United Kingdom in Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33402;Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33402;MVSN or 'Camicie Nere' was created on in February 1923. It was the military organised police corps of the Fascist State, based upon the former "Squadre d'Azione", the paramilitary force that brought Mussolini to power. Its first commander was Italo Balbo (1924) and rapidly the force was put under the direct control of Benito Mussolini (1926-1943).\nThe MVSN climbed up to 111 "Legioni" (Regiment sized units), using 17 to 50 year old men and was divided in various and specialized branches:\n- "Milizia Ordinaria", including "Milizia Coloniale", "Milizia Confinaria" (Border Guards) and "Milizia Universitaria"\n- "Milizia Forestale" (Forest Guards)\n- "Milizia Stradale" (Urban Police)\n- "Milizia Ferroviaria" (protecting railway stations)\n- "Milizia Portularia" (protecting harbours)\n\nIn 1930 the "Milizia per la Difesa Controaerea" (DICAT) was created, protecting essential cities of Italy with AA guns. Another branch from the DICAT, the "Milizia Maritima" (MilMart), was created in 1935 and put in charge of the coastal defense, the Regio Esercito being relieved of this task. From 1934 to the war, the MSVN also raised combat divisions that fought in the Balkans, Russia, Libya, Tunisia and Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33403;Comando Truppe di Zara;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33403;The "Comando Truppe del Presidio di Zara" was created on January, 1st 1936. This garrison force was set up to defend the city and port of Zara, an Italian enclave in Yugoslavian territory.\n\nThe originality of this unit was to merge various types of Italian troops: Guardia alla Frontiera, Milizia Voluntaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, and three different forces from the Regio Esercito Carabinieri Reali, Bersaglieri and armored troops, including L 5/21 tanks and Lanzia 1ZM armored cars.\n\nThis unit is already included in your starting OOB and will be reorganised in 1942 into an occupation force division: 158a Divisione Fanteria "Zara".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33404;Form the 158a Divisione Fanteria "Zara";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33404;On September 1st 1942, the Zara garrison force was renamed 158a Divisione Fanteria "Zara" and set up as an occupation division for the Italian province of Dalmatia. Its initial commander was Carlo Viale, replaced later by Emilio Giglioli. This division is also known to have committed various atrocities and war crimes against Yugoslavian partisans and civilians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33405;65a Divisione Fanteria "Granatieri di Savoia";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33405;The 65a Divisione Fanteria "Granatieri di Savoia" was organised in Ethiopia on October 12th, 1936 and garrisoned in Addis Ababa. Its first commander was General Luigi Perego. The division was assigned to anti-guerilla operations in Ethiopia, before being involved in combat action against Allied troops, particularly in the defensive battle of Cheren. It was finally destroyed on April 20th, 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33406;Ordinamento Baistrocchi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33406;Federico Baistrocchi (1871-1947) was appointed as Chief of the Army General Staff in October 1st, 1934. A highly decorated artillery officer of the Great War, Baistrocchi supported the Fascist movement in Naples and assured Mussolini his troops wouldn't intervene against him. He was elected three times (in 1924, 1929 and 1934) as Deputy for the PNF. As a supporter of Fascism, he made a rapid military ascension, becoming in July 1933 Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of War, held by Mussolini himself, before becoming Chief of Staff of the Royal Army from October 1st, 1934 to October 7th, 1936. \nBaistrocchi issued on November 14th, 1933 the so-called "Ordinamento Baistrocchi" (Baistrocchi's reform), a deep reform of the Italian Army. This reform focused on modernisation of weapons, motorisation and mechanization of troops, dividing forces between standing and defensive ones like the Guardia alla Frontiera. Baistrocchi organized the logistical warfare in Ethiopia and favoured the formation of MVSN divisions for the war.\n\nBaistrocchi's program, perhaps too ambitious, was only partially implemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33407;Appoint Alberto Pariani as Chief of General Staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33407;In October 1936, germanophile Alberto Pariani (1876-1955) replaced Federico Baistrocchi as Chief of the Army General Staff and Undersecretary of War, after Baistrocchi's "promotion", as a consquence of a conflict with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and different political views regarding the involvment of Italian troops in the Spanish Civil War. Pariani fought in WW1 and occupied various functions as military attaché in Albania, general commander of the 18a Divisione 'Brennero' and Deputy Chief of General Staff from 1934 to 1936. He proposed the concept of "guerra di rapido corso" (war of mobility) like other generals from different countries: Basil Liddell-Hart, Heinz Guderian, Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Charles de Gaulle. Pariani led a deep reform of the Italian Army, based on the field experiences in Ethiopia and Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33408;Ordinamento Pariani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33408;By Decret No 2095 of December 22nd, 1938 (called "Ordinamento Pariani") all infantry divisions of the Regio Esercito were set up to a new standard: one of the three infantry regiments was removed and replaced by one 81 mm mortar battalion, one AT-company, and one anti-aircraft battery. These binary divisions, thought to be more able to act rapidly, were tested during the great maneuvers of summer 1937 and 1938. Mussolini was not convinced by this reform but finally accepted Pariani's proposal, which was increasing the total number of infantry divisions of the Army from 31 to 51 along with the creation of new semi-motorized, motorized and armored divisions. To compensate for the lack of power, each division was assigned a battalion and then a brigade of MVSN Blackshirts.\n\n§RNote for player: this event will lock the technology that allows for increasing brigade size.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33409;Pietro Badoglio's Warning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33409;Alberto Pariani was suddenly removed as Undersercretary of War on November 13th, 1939 by Mussolini for not being fit for the position. He was replaced by Rodolfo Graziani, one of Mussolini's favorite marshals. Pariani's reform is frequently used to explain the Italian defeats in WW2, turning all divisions into something unsuitable for a long fight. In fact, the main issue was the lack of motor vehicles, modern tanks, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank weapons because Italian industry was unable to produce the required equipment. Removing Pariani couldn't stop the situation and in early 1940, the Regio Esercito was not ready for war. Field Marshal Pietro Badoglio sent a letter to Mussolini on April, 9th 1940 to warn him about the risk of entering the war alongside Germany. He underlined the lack of available artillery, anti-aircraft guns and effective anti-tank guns as the Army was using the 47/32 AT gun, only effective at close range. A significant amount of equipment had been lost in Ethiopia and Spain. Badoglio estimated that the global efficiency of the army was at 40%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33410;Creation of the "Guardia alla Frontiera";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33410;The "Guardia alla Frontiera" (G.A.F.), was an Italian Army Border Guard created in 1937 which defended the 1,851 km of the northern Italian frontier with the so-called "Vallo Alpino Occidentale" (487 km with France), "Vallo Alpino Settentrionale" (724 km with Switzerland and 420 km with Austria) and "Vallo Alpino Orientale" (220 km with Yugoslavia).\nIn 1940 the G.A.F. had 21,000 military personnel, deployed in eight commands, 27 sectors and was equipped with 7 artillery regiments. It manned 1,000 fortifications, 6,000 machine guns, 1,000 mortars, 100 Cannone da 47/32 M35s, and another thousand other heavy, medium and small-caliber guns (from 75mm to 149mm). By 10th June 1940 - Italy's entry into the war - the G.A.F. contained 23 sectors, 50,000 men, 28 battalions "Vallo Alpino" and 22 battalions of Fascist militia.\nHowever, while the G.A.F. was a predominantly static formation, its dependencies also included five light tank companies, equipped with Fiat 3000 tanks that over time, due to their age and lack of spare parts, were mainly abandoned in sector armories or buried in order to use the turrets as a fort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33411;Additional troops of the Guardia alla Frontiera - "A.S.I";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33411;In late 1937, the Guardia alla Frontiera expanded its forces in Libya to protect the Italian colony from attacks initiated from French Tunisia and British Egypt. Two new divisions were created and the key cities of Tobruch and Tripoli also received some troops and armaments. These troops were later attached to the 5a Armata "Tripolitana" and the 10a Armata "Cirenaica".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33412;Italian Occupation of Albania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33412;The occupation of Albania was led by the "Corpo di Spedizione Oltra Mare Tirana" (OMT) composed of the 23a Divisione Fanteria "Murge", Reggimento di Marina "San Marco", 4 Bersaglieri regiments and 1 Granatieri regiment. This corps received reinforcements and later became the XXVI Corpo d'Armata, in charge of the occupation. It was under the command of General Alfredo Guzzoni and later, Sebastiano Visconti Prasca. Alongside the Regio Esercito's divisions 3a Divisione Alpina "Julia", 19a Divisione Fanteria da Montagna "Venezia", 23a Divisione Fanteria "Ferrara", the newly formed 53a Divisione Fanteria "Arezzo" and 131a Divisione Corazzata "Centauro" this occupation corps was composed of cavalry, Frontier Guards, Albanian volunteers and Camicie Nere, to fight against local resistance and potential enemies like Yugoslavia and Greece. Italy started not only recruiting troops from Albania for the MVSN but also for the Army...\n\n§RNote for player: Former 19a Divisione Fanteria 'Gavinana' will be removed. You'll have to manually attach "Julia" and "Centauro" divisions to this corps.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33413;Start formation of the 101a Divisione Motorizzata "Trieste";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33413;Formation of the 101st Motorized Division "Trieste" started in the mid-1930's, by the conversion of the 8th Infantry Division "Po" into a motorized division. The 8th Infantry Division left some of its regiments to form the Motorized Division "Trento" and was converted into a motorized unit in 1935. The Divisione Motorizzata "Po" was composed of the 66th Reggimento Fanteria "Valtellina", 65th Reggimento Fanteria, and 21th Reggimento Artiglieria Motorizzata.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33414;Creation of the 101a Divisione Motorizzata "Trieste";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33414;The Motorized Division "Po" was upgraded in 1938 and 1939, including some new attached brigades like the 9th Reggimento Bersaglieri and various support units like engineers and anti-tank. On April 4th, the division was renamed 101a  Divisione Motorizzata "Trieste". It was attached to the newly formed Armored Corps (Corpo d'Armata Corazzato), stationed in Piacenza and its commander was Generale Vito Ferroni. \n\nThe division fought in France and Greece and was then sent to North Africa where it participated in the major battles of the Desert War. It finally retreated to Tunisia where it surrendered to Anglo-American forces in May 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33415;Formation of the 102a Divisione Motorizzata "Trento";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33415;The 102a Divisione Motorizzata "Trento" was created upon the core of the former 1a Divisione Motorizzata "Trento", stationed in Libya during the Ethiopian War. In August 1936, it was sent back to Italy and some of its regiments were used to create semi-motorized divisions like the 62a Divisione "Marmarica" (Type AS). In January 1939, the division got its final organisation including the 7th Reggimento Bersaglieri. General Luigi Nuvolini was its commander.\nAt the outbreak of hostilities with the Allies, 102a Divisione "Trento" was attached to the Corpo d'Armata Corazzato (6a Armata del Po), a reserve unit, and did not take part in action. In 1941, the division was sent to Libya, assigned to the XXI Corpo d'Armata in North Africa, and took up positions in Misurata. It then participated in all the German-Italian operations until its last fight during the Second Battle of El Alamein where the divsion was almost destroyed. On November 4th, 1942, only 200 Bersaglieri from the 7th Reggimento could disengage.\n\nActions of the Bersaglieri from the 7th, 8th, 9th and 12th Reggimenti inspired these words to General Rommel: "Il soldato tedesco ha stupito il mondo. Il bersagliere italiano ha stupito il soldato tedesco" (The German soldier has amazed the world, the Italian Bersagliere amazed the German soldier).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33416;Form the 131a Divisione Corazzata "Centauro";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33416;The 131a Divisione Corazzata "Centauro" was created as an armored division in February 1939 and organized from the 1a Brigata Corazzata formed in April 1938. It was attached to the Corpo d'Armata Corazzato and participated in large scale maneuvers in the Po Valley during the late 1930's. The division was put under the command of General Giovanni Magli and rapidly sent to Tirana, attached to the XXVI Corpo d'Armata in Albania, in preparation for a conflict with Greece.\nInitially equipped with the L3/33 and L3/35 tankettes, it received its first M13/40 tanks in December 1940. The divison took part in the Italian-Greek conflict and then in the invasion of Yugoslavia, before being sent back in Italy to be reequipped with better armor in early 1942. Its final destination was North Africa where the division fought in the battles of El Agheila and Kasserine Pass successively. It surrendered to the Allied forces in May 1943 with the fall of Tunisia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33417;Form the 132a Divisione Corazzata "Ariete";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33417;The 132a Divisione Corazzata "Ariete" was created at the same time as its sister division "Centauro", on the basis of the 2a Brigata Corazzata. It was attached to the Corpo d'Armata Corazzato belonging to the 6a Armata del Po, a strategic reserve unit.\nThe division did not take part in the battle of the Alps against France and only saw action in the winter of 1940-1941 when four of its tank battalions were sent to Africa in two formations: Gruppo Maletti (Battalions I and II) and Brigata Corrazata Speciale (Battalions III and IV). The complete destruction of the 10a Armata forced the Italian High Command to send the whole division "Ariete" to Africa in January 1941 where it fought alongside the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK). The "Ariete" was destroyed during the battle of El Alamein.\nIts successive commanders were generals Carlo Vecchiarelli, Ettore Baldassarre, Giuseppe de Stefanis and Francesco Antonio Arena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It was a reserve unit during the invasion of France where it attacked through the Little St. Bernard Pass and were halted by the French defenders.\nIt then took part in the invasion of Yugoslavia, fighting at Mostar and Trebinje. It was reequipped and sent to North Africa in the spring of 1942 where it fought until it was destroyed at the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. Its commander was General Gervasio Bitossi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33419;Form the Comando Superiore dell'Africa Settentrionale Italiana;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33435;XXIV Corpo d'Armata was reconstituted on March 1st, 1943 in Udine by the transformation of the Alpine Army Corps returning from Russia. In June 1943, it was assigned to the Udine area. Under command of General Licurgo Zannini, it organized the defense of the territory and performed, especially in the upper Val Natisone and Judrio, an intense anti-guerrilla action against the irredentist rebels and the infiltration of slavic partisans. It was dissolved on 11 September as a result of the armistice. Units under the command of the XXIV Corpo d'Armata:\n§R- 3a Divisione Alpina "Julia"\n- 52a Divisione Fanteria Autotrasportabile "Torino"\n- Brigata Alpina di Marcia\n- Troops of the XI "Guardia alla Frontiera" sector.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33436;The XXV Corpo d'Armata was created on October 24th, 1940 in Albania and was attached to 11a Armata. Thought to fight in the Albanian and Greek mountains, various alpine and artillery brigades and battalions were assigned as support.\nThis corps, under leadership of General Carlo Rossi had command of various other units in 1940-1941 during the conquest of the Balkans. In 1942-1943, the corps was assigned to 9a Armata and tasked with occupation and anti-partisan duties. Its commanders were, after Rossi, generals Giovanni Vecchi and Umberto Mondino.\nInitially, only three divisions were under its command:\n§R- 23a Divisione Fanteria "Ferrara" \n- 51a Divisione Fanteria "Siena" \n- 131a Divisione Corazzata "Centauro"§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33437;Formed in Padova in November 1940 by the transformation of the former "Corpo d'Armata Celere", Corpo d'Armata Speciale was placed under command of General Giovanni Messe. It arrived in Albania in late December 1940 and was attached to the 11a Armata.\nCorpo d'Armata Speciale was disbanded in 1941 to form the "Corpo di Spedizione Italiano in Russia" (C.S.I.R.).\nThis corps was in charge of three units:\n§R- 6a Divisione Fanteria "Cuneo"\n- 33a Divisione Fanteria "Acqui"\n - Divisione Alpina Speciale, an ad hoc unit based on elements of the 101a Divisione Motorizzata "Trieste"§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33438;Formation of the XXX Corpo d'Armata;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33438;Formation of the XXX Corpo d'Armata started on November 15th, 1940 with the transformation of the "Corpo Armale Celere" into a Special Army Corps Command. It was destined to Albania, assuming the command of the coastal sector on the front of the 11a Armata on the Greek-Albanian border. Various units were temporarily under its command:  "Siena", "Acqui", "Trieste" "Cuneo", "Ferrara", "Centauro", "Brennero" and "Lupi di Toscana".\nFrom October 1st, 1941, the XXX Corpo d'Armata was transfered to the 7a Armata; in Campania. It took over command of the 1a Divisione Fanteria "Superga" and oversaw the defense of the port of Naples and the coastal areas of Villa Literno, Salerno, Battipaglia and Sapri.\nIn 1943 the XXX Corpo d'Armata was transferred to Sassari and assigned to the defense of Sardegna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33439;Formation of the XXXI Corpo d'Armata;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33439;The XXXI Corpo d'Armata Command was established on November 15th in Catanzaro, under command of General Mario Priore. It had the 16a Divisione Fanteria "Pistoia" and the XI Brigata Costiera under its command to organize the coastal defense of Calabria, in the Ionian area, from the San Nicola stream to the Riona Ragali, and in the Tyrrhenian sector, from Foce di Castrocucco to Vallone Condoleo. After having commanded the "Pistoia" Division, it took on the 201a Divisione Costiera and 212a Divisione Costiera. In 1943, the 104a Divisione Fanteria "Mantova" was added as a maneuvering unit, and other coastal divisions were temporarily assigned under its command. The unit was dissolved in 1944.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33440;Formation of the Corpo d'Armata Motocorazzato;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33440;The Corpo d'Armata Motocorazzato was constituted in Roma on July 25th, 1943 to take command of a bunch of motorized and armored troops of the Regio Esercito. Its commander was General Giacomo Carboni.\nStationed in the Roma area, the Corpo d'Armata Motocorazzato sustained hard battles at the outcome of the Armistice of Casabile (September 8th 1943), attempting to defend Rome against the advancing German armed forces. It protected the escape of the King's court with his staff, up to the ceasefire order issued at 10 am, while the fight involved the defenders of Porta San Paolo, viale Giotto, via Laurentina and Monterotondo. The declaration of surrender agreed on 10th of September was stipulated under the command of Brigadier General Giorgio Carlo Calvi di Bergolo, commander of the "Centauro II", husband of the King's firstborn, who took over from Carboni in the convulsive and confused final phase of the battle.\nThe surrender provoked the dissolution of the Corps and the surrender of weapons to the Germans: only the "Piave" Division remained in service, tasked with maintaining public order in the city of Rome.\nUnits under command of this armored corps:\n§R- 21a Divisione Fanteria "Granatieri di Sardegna"\n- 10a Divisione Fanteria Motorizzata "Piave"\n- 135a Divisione corazzata "Ariete II"\n- 136a Divisione corazzata "Centauro II"§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33443;Formation of the 6a Divisione Alpina "Alpi Graie";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33443;The 6a Divisione Alpina "Alpi Graie" was set up on November 15th, 1941, upon already existing alpine units coming from the Guardia Alla Frontiera. Its battalions were sent in 1942 to Montenegro for anti-partisan duties before returning to Liguria in 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33444;Formation of the 52a Divisione autotrasportabile "Torino";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33444;The 52a Divisione autotrasportabile "Torino" was set up in June 1940 just before the outbreak of hostilities with the Allies. Its first commander was General Mario Arisio. In 1941, the 52a Divisione "Torino" was involved in the invasion of Yugoslavia before being sent to Russia (in the C.S.I.R.). It suffered heavy losses in the winter of 1942-1943 and the remnants of the unit (1,600 men) were withdrawn to Gorizia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33445;Formation of the 64a Divisione autotrasportabile "Catanzaro";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33445;The 64a Divisione "Catanzaro" was set up in 1939 but rebuilt as a semi-motorized division in June 1940 and sent to the 10a Armata "Tripolitana" as a reserve division. Motorization was not complete with only 39 trucks out of a total of 105. At the beginning of 1941, this division had been destroyed and the Italian general staff decided to not rebuild this unit because of the controversial behavior of its officers on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33446;Formation of the 40a Divisione Fanteria "Cacciatori d'Africa";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33446;The 40a Divisione "Cacciatori d'Africa" was set up at the end of July 1940 in Africa Orientale Italiana (Ethiopia) as a standard infantry division but with Italian recruits already settled in Africa. This unit was incompletely equipped - just a single group of artillery guns - and fought until the fall of A.O.I in May 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33447;Motorization of the 16a Divisione "Pistoia";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33447;In October 1941, the former infantry division "Pistoia" was set up as a semi-motorized unit. Some of its elements were sent to Athens for garrison duties whereas other parts started to be transferred to North Africa. This division was destroyed in May 1943 in Tunisia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33448;Formation of the occupation divisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33448;At the end of 1941, Italian general staff started to form "occupation" divisions ("Divisioni di Fanteria di Occupazione") numbered from 151 to 159 for security duties in France, Yugoslavia, Greece and Russia. The denomination "di occupazione" was promptly removed for obvious reasons and these divisions ("Perugia", "Picenio", "Macerata", "Murge", "Emilia", "Vicenza", "Novara", "Zara", "Veneto") were simply designated as infantry divisions.\n They had a standard Italian infantry division structure with the addition of Carabinieri Reali troops (CC.RR. = military police).\n\n§RNote for player: The 156a Divisione "Vicenza" will be loaded in the ARM.I.R.

EVTNAME33449;Formation of the "Divisioni Costiere" (Coastal Divisions);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33449;Formation of these defensive divisions started in December 1941 when Italy started to fear an amphibious assault from the Allied forces that the standard garrisons made of Fascist militia couldn't repel. A second wave was launched in July 1942 and the last ones were raised in spring 1943. Around 27 divisions - numbered from 201 to 231 were set up with various compositions. They were grouped from 2 to 4 garrison regiments, manned artillery guns from the Regio Esercito of the Milmart (Milizia Maritima) and were reinforced with AA units of the DICAT.\n When the Allies finally landed in Sicily and continental Italy, these divisions didn't prove to be effective.\n\n§RNote for player: you will receive the first division but will have to build the others by yourself.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33450;Formation of Italian paratroopers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33450;Italian "Paracadutisti" were trained and formed shortly before the Second World War in Castel Benito, near Tripoli, where the first Military Parachute School was located. The first troops trained were two Libyan battalions, the Libyan Parachute Battalion and the 1st National Libyan Parachute Battalion, of the Royal Corps of Colonial Troops. To these were added the first battalions of Italian army troops and the 1st Carabinieri Parachute Battalion (there were three Carabinieri Parachute Battalions). 1 Battalion Royal Carabinieri paratroopers, formed on July 1, 1940, were used in the Second World War on the North African front (1941). Later in Italy, the staff at Castel Benito was expanded into the School at Tarquinia and became the first elements of the future Divisione Folgore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33451;Formation of the 185a Divisione Paracadutisti "Folgore";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33451;The Folgore ("thunder" in italian) Division was an elite paratrooper division of the Regio Esercito Italiano who participated in the battles of El Alamein. Formation of this division started in June 1940 with the creation of three paratrooper battalions who were progressively reinforced in 1941 by other paratroopers, artillery and engineer battalions near Tarquinia. The 1a Divisione Paracadutisti was set up on September 1st, 1941. The division was intended to be used in Operazione C3/Unternehmen Herkules; the planned Axis invasion of Malta, but was finally sent to North Africa under the leadership of General Enrico Frattini under the cover name of 185a Divisione "Cacciatori d'Africa", then renamed the 185a Divisione Paracadutisti "Folgore" in August 1942. The division participated in the battles of El Alamein and faced attacks from three British divisions (the 44th Infantry Division "Home Counties", 50th Infantry Division "Northumbrian" and 7th Armoured Division "Desert Rats"), and the 1st Free French Brigade. Italian paratroopers repulsed several tank and heavy infantry assaults with light automatic weapons. Such actions commanded respect and admiration from their opponents. The division was awarded the Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare.\nIn the course of the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Folgore Division was completely destroyed and therefore officially disbanded on November 1942.\n§RNote for player: if you choose to attack Malta in 1942, you will receive air transports to lift it in Catania.

EVTNAME33452;Formation of the 80a Divisione Fanteria "La Spezia";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33452;The 80a Divisione "La Spezia" was created in 1941 in Pisa to be part of the Operazione C3/Unternehmen Herkules, the Axis planned invasion of Malta. It was an airlanding division almost similar to a standard infantry division without its CC.NN. Battalion. It was then reequipped with field artillery and sent in October 1942 to Tunisia to fight as an infantry unit. It suffered heavy losses in 1943 from British armor attacks, and was finally captured and disbanded in May 1943 with the fall of Italian Tunisia.\n§RNote for player: if you choose to attack Malta in 1942, you will receive air transports to lift it in Catania.

EVTNAME33453;Formation of the 184a Divisione Paracadutisti "Nembo";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33453;The 184a Divisione Paracadutisti "Nembo" was set up in December 1942 on the basis of the 185o Rgt. Paracadutisti of Division "Folgore" which participated in combat against Yugoslavian partisans in Gorizia in April 1943. This regiment was then transferred to the south and fought against the Allies in Sicily (August 1943) whereas the other regiments were sent to defend Sardinia in various tactical groups. After the armistice of September 1943, parts of the "Nembo" Division decided to pursue combat with Nazi Germany. There was both a "Raggruppamento Paracadutisti 'Nembo'" fighting in the ranks of the RSI and a "185th Reparto Autonomo Paracadutisti 'Nembo'" fighting in the Italian Co-Belligerent Army alongside the Allied troops in Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33454;Formation of the 183a Divisione "Ciclone";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33454;Formed in April 1943, the 183a Divisione Paracadutisti "Ciclone" was the third and last Italian paratrooper unit of the war. It was composed of only 4 paratrooper battalions under the command of General Giogio Morigi, defending strategic points in the Apennine Mountains on the road from Florence to Bologna. More than half of the division decided to stay loyal to Germany when the Armistice of Cassibile happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33455;On February 1st 1935 in Asmara, the "Comando Aeronautica per l'Africa Orientale" was formed, an operational HQ of the Regia Aeronautica created for the planned war against Ethiopia. Its first commander was Ferruccio Ranza, replaced by Mario Ajmone-Cat in Deptember 1935. This air command built 4 airbases and 10 airfields, received a total of 450 airplanes, from old IMAM Ro 1 recon aircraft to modern Savoia-Marchetti S.M.81 bombers. The bulk of this was composed of Caproni Ca. 101s, Ca. 111s and Ca. 133s for bombing and transport missions.\n\nMussolini's airforce was used intensively with complete air superiority against unprepared and unequipped ground troops as Ethiopian soldiers only had at this time a very limited number of Oerlikon light anti-aircraft guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33456;Use chemical weapons in Abyssinia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33456;During the Second Abyssinian War (October 1935-May 1936), Mussolini's forces used chemical weapons which were banned by the Geneva Protocol of 1925 as a consequence of the horrors of the Great War. Weapons were stocked in Africa years before the war but initially, the Italian command was reluctant to use that kind of weapon, fearing international retaliation. At the end of October 1935, Mussolini authorized Rudolfo Graziani to use gas as an "ultimate weapon" against heavy resistance. Two months later, Mussolini finally authorized Marshal Badoglio to use gas on a large scale.\nIn early 1936, Italian planes delivered large drops of chemical gas, mainly mustard gas, against enemy troops, civilians and Red Cross hospitals, staffed by British, Swedish, and Belgians.\n\nInternational protests started in the League of Nations, based on various foreign observer reports. Italy admitted bombing mistakes against Red Cross hospitals but justified the use of chemical weapons as retaliation for "war crimes" committed by Ethiopia: the execution of downed Italian airman Tito Minniti (which occurred two months after Mussolini first authorised the use of gas as an ultima ratio), mutilations of captured Eritrean Askari and use of Dum-Dum bullets, banned by the Hague Convention of 1899.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33457;The Corpo Aereo Italiano (CAI) was an air expeditionary force that participated in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz during the final months of 1940. Mussolini insisted on providing air support to assist Germany during this operation. The CAI was created on September 10th and arrived in Belgium in separate parts two weeks later, under the command of Air General Rino Corso Fougier. Between October 1940 and January 1941, the CAI fighters flew 454 offensive and 480 defensive sorties, including 113 bomber escort ones. After this, the bombers were reassigned to new locations.\n\nThe CAI had limited success during its brief existence, but was generally hampered by the inadequacy of its equipment. Most of its losses were due to technical and weather issues.\n\n§RNote for player: this force will be deployed in Bruxelles.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33459;After the annexation of Albania, Italian High Command started the absorption of Albanian troops into the Italian Army by the Law N°1115 of July 13th, 1939. Local troops were especially integrated into the Carabinieri Reali and the Regia Guardia di Finanza but new troops were also recruited by the MVSN and the Regio Esercito.\nThe Albanian Fascist Militia ("Milizia Fascista Albanese" MFA) was created soon after the invasion, in April 1939. 4 "Legioni" were raised, totalizing 14 CC.NN. battalions. It was initially recruited from Italian colonists in Albania but later, Albanian natives were also recruited. They were wearing the standard MVSN uniform but kept as a distinction the Qeleshe, a traditional white felt skull cap.\n\nThe Regio Esercito integrated Albanian troops into its units, like the "Guardia Reale Albanese", an honor battalion that was attached to the 1° Reggimento of the 21a Divisione Fanteria "Granatieri di Sardegna" in November 1939. Auxiliary battalions of Albanian troops were also raised in 1940 to prepare for war with Greece but the recruitment plan was not fulfilled. War records were mixed: some units from the former Albanian army did well, some were dissolved during the first two months of the conflict, due to casualties and desertions.\nLight infantry regiments named "Cacciatori d'Albania" were finally set up in 1942 for occupational duties and anti-partisan operations. In these units, officers were Italian and soldiers were mostly Albanian muslims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33460;Addis Ababa massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33460;An attempted assassination of Marshal Rodolfo Graziani occurred on February 19th, 1937. Two young Eritreans named Abraha Deboch and Mogus Asgedom threw a handful of grenades to kill the Supreme Governor and Viceroy of Italian East Africa but only injured him lightly. The Italian response was immediate: for two days, security forces were given a "carte blanche" to kill any Ethiopian in the city. Carabinieri, the regular army, and Blackshirts killed people blindly using daggers, truncheons, and hand grenades, burning native houses with petrol while screaming "Duce! Duce! Duce!" and "Civiltà Italiana!" (Italian civilization). Ethiopian intellectual elites were arrested and sentenced to death, and thousands were sent to detention and concentration camps like Nokra or Danane. Recent research estimates that 19,200 people were killed, 20% of the population of Addis Ababa at the time. \nRepression didn't stop in February: in May, Italian investigators found that Abraha and Mogus had stayed a while at the Copt monastry of Debra Libanos and that the monks had knowledge of their plans. Graziani ordered the summary execution of 297 monks and 23 laymen living there.\nThis episode is named "Yekatit 12", date of the Ethiopian calendar, "strage di Addis Abeba" in Italian, and "Graziani massacre" in English. It was one of the worst war atrocities committed by the Italian occupation forces and the worst in Ethiopian history.\nGraziani was nicknamed the "Ethiopian Butcher", but was not judged after war for the crimes he ordered in Ethiopia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33461;MilMART 1939.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33461;The Milizia Marritima di Artiglieria (MilMART) was a specialized branch of the MVSN, formed in 1935 from the Milizia per la Difesa Antiaerea Territoriale (DICAT). It was raised to operate coastal artillery batteries and defend Italian coasts from invasions. The MilMART was officialy set up in 1939, with its school and command located in Messina. It absorbed 25,000 men in 1940, grouped in ten legions and four autonomous groups. Logistics and armaments were provided by the Regia Marina but troops were recruited on the MSVN standards. The MILMART manned more than 400 hundred guns of various calibers, from the giant 381/40 2 gun armored turrets of Brindisi to smaller ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33462;After the defeats in North Africa, an Allied invasion of Italian mainland appeared inevitable. Fascist Italy started to reinforce its coastal garrisons, particularly in Sicily where the 6th, 7th and 8th Legions of the MilMART were insufficient to defend the island. Some more battalions of "Camicie Nere Costiera" were raised and put in defense of the main ports and cities: Messina, Agrigento, Ragusa, Trapani and Siracusa.\nThese units fought against the Allies in 1943 defending Lampedusa island and later, the Sicilian coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33463;BETASOM;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33463;BETASOM (Italian acronym for "Bordeaux Sommergibile") was an Italian submarine base located in Bordeaux during the occupation of France by Nazi German forces. Italy sent the "11th Gruppo del Fero Subacqueo Italiano in Atlantico" there under the command of Admiral Angelo Parona in order to help Germany in its blockade strategy against England. BETASOM was not placed under the command of the German Kriegsmarine and remained an independent expeditonary force until 1943.\n28 submarines were sent to Bordeaux between 1940 and 1943, mostly from September to November 1940. The garrison force was made up of a naval infantry battalion coming from the San Marco Regiment and several batteries of German anti-aircraft guns. The naval force was supported by the French-captured liner Amiral de Grasse and the German cargo ship Usaramo. Organisation Todt started the construction of heavy fortifications to protect submarines from British air raids but they were not finished until 1944. Italy sent some of its most modern submarines (built from 1938 to 1940) there, going through the Gibraltar strait without difficulties. In 1941, some units (Perla, Guglielmotti, Brin, Argo, Velella, Dandolo, Emo, Otaria, Mocenigo, Veniero, Glauco) were retrieved and sent back to the Mediterranean to reinforce the Regia Marina.\nOverall, the Italian submarines sank 109 Allied merchant ships totalling 601,425 tons, and suffered a loss of 16 boats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Through air and sea landings, the Italians and Germans hoped to eliminate Malta as a British air and naval base and secure an uninterrupted flow of supplies across the Mediterranean Sea to Axis forces in Libya and Egypt. Military planning for the invasion started during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War when the Italian army command identified the seizure of Malta as a prerequisite for massive operations in northern Africa. Multiple plans for seaborne assaults were drawn and periodically revised until the meeting between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini (29th-30th April 1942).

EVTDESC33474;The Italian Battleship "Conte di Cavour" was ordered in the 1910s, finished in 1915 but was not used in combat during WW1. She was rebuilt at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico in Trieste between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before (from 22 to 28 knots). Its main armament was made of 2 triple and 2 twin 320 mm guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33478;The Vittorio Veneto was the second of the Littorio battleship class that served during World War II. The ship was laid down in October 1934, launched in July 1937, and readied for service with the Italian fleet by August 1940. She was named after the Italian victory at Vittorio Veneto during World War I. She was armed with a main battery of nine 381 mm guns in three triple turrets, and could steam at a speed of 30 knots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33479;Vittorio Veneto is lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33480;Littorio is launched!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33480;The Littorio was the lead ship of her class of battleship. She was named after the Lictor ("Littorio" in Italian), in ancient times the bearer of the Roman fasces, which was adopted as the symbol of Italian Fascism. Littorio and her sister Vittorio Veneto were built in response to the French battleships Dunkerque and Strasbourg. They were Italy's first modern battleships, and the first 35,000-ton capital ships of any nation to be laid down under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Littorio was laid down in October 1934, launched in August 1937, and completed in May 1940. It was armed with three triple 381 mm gun turrets and could steam at a speed of 30 knots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33484;The Italian battleships Impero and Roma were the third and fourth ships of the Littorio Class, laid down in May and September 1938 respectively. Only the Roma was finished in 1942. Construction of the Impero was cancelled as the Regia Marina decided to focus its resources on escort ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33485;Roma is launched!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33485;Roma was the third Littorio-class battleship, laid down in September 1938 at the "Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico" of Trieste. The ship was finished in June 1942 but remained largely inactive during WW2, stationed in La Spezia harbor. She was equipped with nine 381/50 mod 1934 guns in three turrets as primary armament and could steam at 31 knots. She was sunk on September 9th, 1943 by German guided bombs while trying to join the Allies after the armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33489;Achille Starace 'Colonna Celere';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33489;Achille Starace (1889-1945) was a hierarch of the Fascist Party - or PNF. A former Bersagliere during WW1, he rapidly became a supporter of Benito Mussolini and became vice-secretary of the Party in 1921. In 1935, Starace was authorized to participate in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.\nHe was given the command of a mixed group of Blackshirts and Bersaglieri being assembled in Asmara, totaling 3000 men and 500 motor vehicles. This truck column prepared to advance over rough terrain to seize Gondar, capital of Beremder Province. "L'uomo pantera" (the panther man) managed to cover 120km in three days, taking Gondar in the morning of the first of April 1936 and reaching Lake Tana only two days later, securing the border with British Sudan.\nStarace wrote of his achievements in his book, 'La Marcia su Gondar della Colonna Celere' where you can find an extract of the speech he gave to his men :\n "Soldiers, this is the most risky, most difficult and most important venture of the campaign. Don't waste a shot. (...) Britain is a rich country, Italy is a poor country, but the people of poor countries have hard muscles. The only way to explain the action of the English is that they thought they had only to mass a war fleet in the Mediterranean and Premier Mussolini would take off his hat and bow in submission. Instead he reared up like a thoroughbred horse and sent his soldiers into Africa. Viva Il Duce!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33490;Achille Starace and the ring of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33490;After Ethiopia, Achille Starace came back to Italy to assume his functions: President of the Italian Olympic Committee, and National Secretary of the PNF. Loyal and obedient, he was appointed despite his limitated intellectual capacities. When Marshal Balbo qualified him as an idiot, Mussolini answered that an idiot he was, for sure, but an obedient idiot.\nStarace is specially and more significantly remembered also for a policy of enrollment of the Italian people (whether young or not) in Fascist party-linked organizations like Opera Balilla, Figli della Lupa, Avanguardisti, Giovane Fascista and the labor-related Organizzazione del Dopolavoro.\nStarace was a sports fanatic, doing hours of sport, particularly equitation, every day. He is remembered for such unlikely sports stunts as jumping through a fire circle at the Marmi Stadium in 1938 and horse jumping over a saloon car.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33491;Achille Starace's end;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33491;Starace rapidly ended his political career, being mocked by almost everyone in Italy. Called a "dire jester" by Field Marshal Emilio de Bono, and a "harlequin of an equestrian show" by head of Secret Police Arturo Bocchini, Starace became the object of political satire and popular jokes under Fascism, especially from students.\nAfter being assigned to the general Staff of the MVSN in 1939, he participated in the disastrous Greek campaign where he was wounded and then evacuated. Mussolini removed him from his command and he was never trusted again by the Fascist rulers. He met his fate on April 29th, 1945 when, on his morning jog, he was captured by partisans and taken to see Mussolini's body in the Piazzale Loreto. After saluting it, he was executed and strung up alongside it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC33493;The Military Academy of Modena ('Accademia militare di Modena') was the first such military institution to be created in the world, in the late 17th Century. Initially located in Turin and many times reorganized - even by French consul Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 - it was divided into two schools in 1927; the Military Academy of Infantry and Cavalry located in Modena and the Military Academy of Artillery and Engineers in Turin, acquiring the title of Royal Academies in 1928. Since 1937 the Military Academy of Modena has also hosted courses for the training of officers of the Carabinieri (Military Police).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Officially he was mistaken for an English bomber because at the same time Tobruk was being bombed by English forces. Unofficially, many said that Mussolini ordered his murder because Balbo harshly criticized  Mussolini's alliance with Hitler.\n\nThe day after his death, a British plane dropped a message on Italian lines stating that the British forces expressed their grief for the death of The Marshal of Air, Italo Balbo, a great leader and a valiant aviator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME58786;Italian Auxiliary Cruiser Ramb III;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC58786;Ramb III was a pre-war banana boat that was converted for military use in March 1938. Armed with 4 120mm guns, she was in Italian waters when war broke out and so was unable to reach her intended posting in East Africa. Historically, she served primarily as a minelayer before being torpedoed in 1941. She was towed to Trieste and refloated into service by the Germans in September 1943 before hitting one of her own mines off Ancona. She reached Fiume where she was sunk in November 1944 by Allied aircraft. After the war, she was refloated by the Brodospas and served first as a training ship in 1952, renamed Galeb. She would then spend four decades as the presidential yacht of President Josip Broz Tito. She remains afloat as a museum ship in Rijeka to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME58787;Italian Auxiliary Cruiser Ramb IV;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC58787;Ramb IV was a pre-war banana boat that was converted for military use in June 1937. Armed with 4 120mm guns, she served with the Red Sea Flotilla. Historically, she was converted to a hospital ship in 1940 to ferry wounded from Eritrea back to Italy. Unable to do this due to the British control of the Suez, she would be captured and pressed into service by the British in 1941, before being sunk by German aircraft off Alexandria on May 10th, 1942.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME36000;The Sultanate of Aussa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC36000;The Sultanate of Aussa was a small, wealthy state that enveloped the modern borders of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somaliland. In April 1936 Italian forces occupied it and its Sultan, Mohamed Yayyo, met with Mussolini in Rome and declared his support for the expansion of Italian East Africa, allowing his sultanate to be annexed.\n\n"Duce, from the earliest times, my family has been an enemy of the Abyssinians, enemies of mighty Italy. My grandfather and my father have always been friends of Italy, and I with heart and sword, am a soldier of the Italian Empire...

EVTNAME36002;Amedeo Guillet is in Yemen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC36002;Amedeo Guillet was an Italian equestrian and cavalry commander. Descended from a noble family, he graduated from the Military Academy at Modena and was given command of a Bande - consisting of Eritrean cavalry and Yemeni infantry - in Eritrea despite just being a lieutenant. He served in the war in Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War before returning to Italian East Africa. His Bande, the Bande Amahara, was renowned for its immaculate conduct and treatment of local populations. Guillet could boast that he was one of the only Italian commanders in East Africa who could sleep safely with the local population having full knowledge of his location. During the war with the Allies, he carried out numerous heroic cavalry charges against superior British opposition, including charging an armoured column with sabres drawn. His unit suffered heavy casualties but remained loyal. After Ethiopia fell, Guillet went into hiding and conducted a guerrilla war, changing his name to Ahmed Abdallah Al Redai and disguising himself as an Arab water seller. Eventually, he secured transport across the Red Sea to Yemen, where he befriended the King's son, Ahmad bin Yahya. He worked training the Yemeni army until he was able to secure passage back to Italy in 1943. We should endeavour to bring him home as soon as possible, so that we can assign him back to the front and make use of his skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
