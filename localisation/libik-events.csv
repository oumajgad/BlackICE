EVTNAME93123;6th South African Armoured Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93123;The 6th South African Armoured Division was the second armoured division of the South African Army and was formed during World War II. Established in early 1943, it was based on a nucleus of men from the former 1st South African Infantry Division who had returned to South Africa after the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. The division was initially transferred to Egypt for training, after which it served in the Allied campaign in Italy during 1944 and 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93714;36th Infantry Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93714;The division was formed in early 1943 as the Army component of the Combined Training Centre in India, in 1943 the 29th and 72nd British Brigades were allocated to this formation, although all the other units were Indian, at this time they were under command of the Indian Expeditionary Forces. The division took part in the Arakan Operations in 1944, in support of the 5th Indian Division in the jungle covered hill country around the Ngayadauk Pass and the Mayu Tunnels Area. In January 1945 the division crossed the Irrawaddy and came under the command of the Fourteenth Army and saw much of the hard fighting that led to the final operation that broke the last Japanese resistance in Burma. The division was returned to India in June 1945 and was disbanded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93715;11th East Africa Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93715;The division was formed in early 1943 and was composed of troops from Kenya, Uganda, Nyasaland, Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia, and from the Belgian Congo. The 11th (East Africa) Division fought with the Fourteenth Army in Burma during the Burma Campaign. In the later part of 1944, the division pursued the Japanese retreating from Imphal down the Kabaw valley and established bridgeheads over the Chindwin River. In 1945, elements of the division played a part in the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93716;81st West Africa Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93716;The inspiration for the division's formation came from General George Giffard, commander of the British Army's West Africa Command, who subsequently commanded India Command's Eastern Army, facing the Japanese army on the frontier between India and Burma. Giffard had wide experience with African troops, and was eager for them to participate in the war. One of the brigades (the 3rd West African) and several of the supporting units which formed the division had already seen action with the 11th (African) Division, against the Italians in East Africa. The division was established as the 1st (West African) Division on 1 March 1943. Three days later it was renamed the 81st (West African) Division, taking the next vacant number in the list of British infantry divisions. The division's badge was a spider, in black on a yellow circular background. This spider was a reference to Ananse, a cunning character in Ashanti mythology, and drawn so that when a soldier raised his weapon to fire, the spider would appear to be going forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93717;82nd West Africa Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93717;The division was formed from the existing 1st (West African) Infantry Brigade and 2nd (West African) Infantry Brigade, both of which had previously taken part in the East African Campaign in 1940 and 1941, and the freshly raised 4th (Nigerian) Infantry Brigade. The division's headquarters was created on 1 August 1943. It followed the 81st (West African) Division in the numbering sequence of British war-raised infantry divisions. The division's formation sign was crossed spears on a porter's headband, in black (sometimes white) on a yellow shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93718;11th African Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93718;The division was formed on 24 July 1940 in East Africa. On 24 November, the division was re-designated as the British Army's 11th (African) Division. The division was composed primarily of West African and East African troops. It was disbanded on 23 November 1941 and its component units reassigned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93719;12th African Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93719;On 19 July 1940, the 2nd (African) Division was formed in Kenya, British East Africa. On 24 November, the division was redesignated as the British Army's 12th (African) Division. The division was disbanded in East Africa on 18 April 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93723;70th Infantry Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93723;The 70th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that fought during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. What would become the 70th Division originated with the 7th Infantry Division, which was formed in 1938 to serve in the British Mandate of Palestine during the Arab Revolt. This division then transferred to Egypt at the outbreak of the Second World War and soon became the 6th Infantry Division, which went on to take part in the Battle of Crete and the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. On 10 October 1941, the 6th Division was re-created as the 70th Infantry Division in an attempt to deceive Axis intelligence concerning the strength of British forces in the Middle East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93724;50th Indian Armoured Brigade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93724;The 50th Indian Tank Brigade was an armoured brigade formation of the Indian Army during World War II. It was formed for service in the Burma Campaign in 1941 from units of the British Army and the British Indian Army. The brigade's emblem was a white upraised fist and forearm on a black disc. The 50th Indian Tank Brigade was placed under the command of XV Corps in October 1944 as armoured support for the Arakan campaign and was located north of Maungdaw at Waybin in early December. Units of the brigade took part in actions at Buthidaung, the Mayu Peninsula, the Myebon Peninsula and Kangaw. The brigade was withdrawn from Arakan in February 1945.\n\nThis starts the event chain for 3 additional Indian Armoured Brigades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93725;252nd Indian Armoured Brigade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93725;It was formed from the 3rd (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade when it was dispersed and reformed as the 2nd Indian Armoured Brigade in 1940, from July 1941 the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade Group, and from December 1941, the 252nd Indian Independent Armoured Brigade Group. In January 1942 it was attached to the 10th Indian Infantry Division. Thereafter it served with the 31st Indian Armoured Division (from July 1942 redesignated the 252nd Indian Armoured Brigade) in the Middle East until being redesignated 2nd Indian Independent Armoured Brigade in December 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93726;254th Indian Armoured Brigade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93726;The brigade was formed in 1941 and later was part of the Fourteenth Army and saw action in the Burma Campaign. The 254th Tank Brigade's emblem was a symbol that looks like black railway tracks disappearing into the distance, on a red triangle. The brigade fought with the 5th and 7th Indian Infantry Divisions in Burma and was involved in the Battles at Imphal, Kohima, Kyaumaung Bridgehead, Meiktila, and the Rangoon Road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93727;255th Indian Armoured Brigade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93727;The brigade was raised in June 1941 as 5th Indian Armoured Brigade and redesignated the 255th Indian Armoured Brigade in October 1941. The brigade's tactical sign was a black bull, with yellow horns and red eyes, on a royal blue triangle. The brigade fought with the 17th Indian Infantry Division in Burma and was involved in the Battle of Meiktila, the Battle of Pokoku and Irrawaddy River operations and during Operation Dracula. The brigade was redesignated in June 1946 as the 1st Armoured Brigade and assigned to the 1st Armoured Division, with which it was serving at Secunderabad when the Partition of India took place in August 1947.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93730;1st Polish Corps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93730;After the defeat of Poland in 1939, many Polish soldiers and civilians made their way to the Atlantic ports where around 24,000 were evacuated to Britain. The Polish Army was located in Scotland from the summer of 1940 and began immediate rebuilding. The troops were to remain in Scotland until the end of the war.\n\nOrganised into the Polish Corps (later the 1st Polish Corps following the formation of the 2nd Corps in the Middle East), Polish troops were involved in the defence of the Fife region of eastern Scotland from a potential German invasion from Norway. The Corps became the base on which the 1st Armoured Division (1 Dywizja Pancerna), the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade (1 Samodzielna Brygada Spadochronowa), the 2 Dywizja Grenadierów Pancernych and 16th Independent Armoured Brigade (16 Brygada Czolgów) were formed during the war.\n\nThe 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade (1. Samodzielna Brygada Spadochronowa) was a parachute brigade under command of Maj. Gen. Stanislaw Sosabowski, created in Scotland in September 1941, with the exclusive mission to drop into occupied Poland in order to help liberate the country. All Polish units under British command (over 240,000 soldiers) could be sent into action at any part of the Western front. The 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade would fight for Poland on Polish territory.\n\nAdditional units will be formed through their own events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93731;Polish 1st Armoured Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93731;The Polish 1st Armoured Division (1 Dywizja Pancerna) was an armoured division of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. Created in February 1942 at Duns in Scotland, it was commanded by Major General Stanislaw Maczek and at its peak numbered approximately 16,000 soldiers. They were organized on the British Armoured Division model, equipped with British uniforms, weapons and tanks. They were initially equipped and trained on Crusader tanks but in late 1943 and early 1944 these were replaced with Sherman and Cromwell tanks. They then participated in war games together with the 4th Canadian Armoured Division.\n\nThe division served in the final phases of the Battle of Normandy in August 1944 during Operation Totalize and the Battle of Chambois and then continued to fight throughout the campaign in Northern Europe, mainly as part of the First Canadian Army. The Division ended the war in Wilhelmshaven and, joined by the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, undertook occupation duties until it was disbanded in 1947. It, together with the many Polish displaced persons in the Western occupied territories, formed a Polish enclave at Haren in Germany, which was for a while known as 'Maczków'. The majority of its soldiers opted not to return to Poland, which fell under Soviet occupation, preferring instead to remain in exile. Many artefacts and memorabilia belonging to Maczek and the 1st Polish Armoured Division are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93732;2nd Armoured Grenadier Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93732;The 2nd Armoured Grenadier Division (2 Dywizja Grenadierów Pancernych) was formed in April 1943 by renaming the 1st Grenadier Division Kadrowa (1 Dywizja Grenadierów (kadrowa)). It had one armoured and one infantry brigade, same as the Polish 1st Armoured Division (1 Dywizja Pancerna).\n\nThe division never served in Europe and was reorganized into the 4th Infantry Division in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93733;2nd Polish Corps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93733;Polish II Corps (Drugi Korpus Wojska Polskiego) was a major tactical and operational unit of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. It was commanded by Lieutenant General Wladyslaw Anders and by the end of 1945 it had grown to well over 100,000 soldiers. Following the signing of the Polish-Russian Military Agreement on August 14,1941, a Polish Army on Soviet soil was born. The first commander, General Michal Tokarzewski, began the task of forming this army in the Soviet town of Totskoye on August 17. The commander chosen by General Wladyslaw Sikorski to ultimately lead the new army, General Wladyslaw Anders, had been just released from the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, on August 4, and did not issue his first orders or announce his appointment as commander until August 22. The Polish II Corps was created in 1943 from various units fighting alongside the Allies in all theatres of war.\n\nThe 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division (3 Dywizja Strzelców Karpackich), also commonly known as Christmas Tree Division due to the characteristic emblem, was an infantry division of the Polish Armed Forces in the West that fought during World War II on the Italian Front. It was formed in 1942 of the Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade and the forces of Lieutenant-General Wladyslaw Anders Polish 2nd Corps evacuated from the Soviet Union. The division participated in the North African and the Italian Campaigns as part of the British Eighth Army. Notable actions in Italy include the victories in the Battle of Monte Cassino, Ancona and Bologna. Disbanded after the war, most soldiers chose not to return to the new, Communist Poland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93734;Polish 5th Kresowa Infantry Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93734;The Polish 5th Kresowa Infantry Division (5 Kresowa Dywizja Piechoty) was an infantry division of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. Formed in March 1943, it fought in the Italian Campaign as part of Lieutenant general Wladyslaw Anders' Polish II Corps, under command of the British Eighth Army.\n\nThe division landed in southern Italy in February 1944 and entered the line in March, as part of Polish II Corps, destined to fight in the Italian Campaign. In May it took part in the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino, in which it suffered a 15% casualty rate. In June-July the division participated in the Battle of Ancona. In the fall of 1944 it fought on the approaches to the Gothic Line. After the front line stabilized for the winter, the division renewed active operations in April 1945, where it took part in the final offensive in Italy, advancing to liberate Bologna at the end of the war. During its war service in Italy the division suffered 5,127 casualties, including 1,063 killed in action. The majority of these losses were sustained by the infantry battalions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93735;2nd Warsaw Armoured Division;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93735;The 2nd (Warsaw) Armoured Brigade (2 Warszawska Brygada Pancerna) was an armoured brigade of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II that existed from 1942 to 1945. From 1945 to 1947 it was redesignated as the 2nd Warsaw Armoured Division. The unit was the armoured wing of the 2nd (Polish) Corps.\n\nThe 2nd (Warsaw) Armoured Brigade fought in Italy and spent most of its time providing armoured support to the two polish infantry divisions of the 2nd Corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93740;4th Armoured Brigade Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93740;When the Mobile Division became 7th Armoured Division, the Heavy Armoured Brigade (Egypt) was renamed to 4th Armoured Brigade. The 4th Armoured Brigade had a black jerboa as its emblem, earning the nickname 'The Black Rats'.\n\nThe 4th Armoured Brigade saw service in the North African Campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Italian Campaign and in North-western Europe. Although it served under many different formations it was most famous as part of the 7th Armoured Division. The 4th Armoured Brigade left the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa in 1943 for the Allied Invasion Force for Normandy. In June 1944, the brigade landed in Normandy and served with distinction during the Battle of Normandy during the Battle for Caen.\nIn its entire history it the 4th Armoured Brigade had only been in the United Kingdom for about six months. Some of the regiments that served have been disbanded or merged over the years, but the Black Rat (Jerboa) emblem is still worn proudly by the men of the 4th Mechanized Brigade which the 4th Armoured Brigade became in 2007. It is good to know that one of the first Brigades that served with the Division, but left it, now continues its heritage, still wearing the 'Black Rat' badge. Likewise the other original Armoured Brigade (the 7th) is also still serving in the British Army, who still wear their 'Desert Rat' badge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93741;7th Armoured Brigade Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93741;When the Mobile Division became 7th Armoured Division, the Light Armoured Brigade became the 7th Armoured Brigade in February 1940. The 7th Armoured Division had a red jerboa (a nocturnal rodent indigenous to North Africa) as its emblem and became known as 'The Desert Rats'. The 7th Armoured Brigade, meanwhile, had a green jerboa as its emblem. The 7th Brigade became independent and known as the 'Green Rats' or the 'Jungle Rats' after it moved to Burma in early 1942.\n\nIt moved to fight in the Burma Campaign in early 1942 just as the Imperial Japanese Army were pushing the Allies back. The brigade took part in the fighting retreat to India, successfully completed in May just before the monsoons would have cut them off. The 7th Armoured Brigade returned to the Middle East in 1943, based in Iraq and later Egypt. With Axis forces defeated in North Africa, the brigade's time was a quiet one until it moved to the Italian Front in April 1944 where it remained for the duration of the Second World War; fighting as part of I Canadian Corps, itself part of the British Eighth Army. The brigade, now composed of the 2nd, 6th and 8th Royal Tank Regiments, fought in the final stages of the Battle of Monte Cassino and later the Gothic Line and in Operation Grapeshot, the final offensive in Italy.\nIn its entire history it the 7th Armoured Brigade never served in the United Kingdom. Some of the regiments that served have been disbanded or merged over the years, but the Jerboa emblem is still worn proudly by the men of the 7th Armoured Brigade. It is good to know that one of the first Brigades that served with the Division, but left it, now continues its heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93742;8th Armoured Brigade Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93742;The 8th Armoured Brigade was an armoured brigade of the British Army formed in August 1941, during the Second World War and active until 1956. The brigade was formed by the renaming of 6th Cavalry Brigade, when the 1st Cavalry Division based in Palestine (of which it was part) converted from a motorised formation (having been horse-mounted until January 1940) to an armoured unit, becoming 10th Armoured Division. The brigade became independent in late 1942 and fought as such for the rest of the war. \n\nIt was transferred to Egypt in 1941, serving under HQ Middle East, XXX Corps, British Eighth Army, XXX Corps and X Corps. The brigade fought at the Battles of Alam Halfa and El Alamein, later in 1943 it took part in the Tunisian Campaign. The high level of experience gained by the brigade in North Africa contrasted with many of the other armoured units earmarked for the Operation Neptune (D-Day), some of whom had not seen action since the fall of France in 1940. After landing the brigade continued to fight in NW Europe for the rest of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93743;9th Armoured Brigade Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93743;The 9th Armoured Brigade was formed by the redesignation of the 4th Cavalry Brigade, a 1st Line Yeomanry (mounted) brigade in the Territorial Army, which had been part of the 1st Cavalry Division. It was converted to an armoured role on 3 August 1941 in the Middle East.\n\nThe Brigade was nominally independent, but was placed under command of the 2nd New Zealand Division specifically for the El Alamein battle. Following their permission, they proudly painted the Kiwis' divisional sign on their tanks. The NZ infantry gained their objectives, but lanes could not be cleared through the minefields until night was almost over. As dawn came on 2 November, tank after tank was hit by the German 88 mm guns that kept firing through seven air attacks. They took 75 percent casualties and lost 102 of their 128 tanks. Nevertheless, they breached the gun line and the 1st Armoured Division was now able to engage. After the Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of the 6th NZ Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, 'Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to know where your tanks are?' Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him, replying 'There they are.' Gentry was puzzled. 'I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?' Currie waved his arm and again replied, 'There are my armoured regiments, Bill.'\nIn an account of the battle published to mark its 25th anniversary, Montgomery wrote 'I must mention the magnificent fight put up by 9th Armoured Brigade.... If the British armour owed any debt to the infantry of 8th army, the debt was paid on 2 November by 9th Armoured Brigade in heroism and blood..';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93744;23rd Armoured Brigade Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93744;The 23rd Armoured Brigade, originally formed as the 23rd Army Tank Brigade was a 2nd Line Territorial Army (TA) formation. It was reorganised and renamed the 23rd Armoured Brigade, when it was assigned to the 8th Armoured Division, although it never operated under command of the division.\n\nThe division remained in the United Kingdom until May 1942 when it was sent to the Middle East to join the Eighth Army, becoming active there in early July. In mid-July the brigade, now commanded by Brigadier L. E. Misa, was detached from the 8th Armoured Division and with the addition of the 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery became known as the 23rd Armoured Brigade Group. After only 14 days of acclimatisation and without any infantry support training, the brigade was chosen to reinforce an attack by XXX Corps during the Second Battle of Ruweisat Ridge, part of the First Battle of El Alamein. It was virtually annihilated by German anti-tank fire while in the minefield and had to be rebuilt by cannibalising men and tanks from the newly arrived 24th Armoured Brigade. It also took part in Second Battle of El Alamein and in the Tunisian Campaign.\nThe 23rd Armoured Brigade took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, although only the 50th RTR and B Squadron of the 46th RTR participated in the initial landings. The brigade historian commented that 'Sicily was the hardest, the bloodiest, and above all, the most disillusioning campaign in which the brigade had served during the war.' \nIt participated in the initial landings at Salerno during Operation Avalanche, which began the Italian Campaign. It was assigned to the British 46th Infantry Division during the landings, after that it came under the command of X Corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME93745;1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93745;The Brigade, under General Alois Liska, was trained, organised and equipped along British lines. This nucleus of troops formed an Infantry Brigade in mid April 1943, later converted to an Armoured Brigade in September 1943. The men of the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group (CIABG) were anxious to get to grips with the enemy who had forced them from their homes, but had to wait until 30 August 1944 before the Brigade was deployed to France, initially assembling at Falaise.\n\nLiska's men, as part of First Canadian Army were assigned the role of containing the German garrison trapped in the port of Dunkirk. 2nd Canadian Infantry Division had arrived at Dunkirk in September 1944, contained the defenders and handed over the task of besieging the valuable port to the CIABG on 6 October 1944. The mobile formation had to content itself with maintaining an impenetrable cordon around the city, prohibited by the French authorities from mounting any prolonged bombardment of the historic centre.\n\nMorale did suffer as it became apparent that the Brigade was not to be permitted to join the U.S. forces which were heading toward the Czechoslovakian homeland. Only a token force of 150 men was permitted to accompany the U.S. Troops headed toward their eventual meeting with advancing Soviet forces. On the positive side, casualties incurred during the siege were relatively light, amounting to 167 dead, 461 wounded and 40 missing. One peculiarity was that the availability of Czechs who had been forced to fight in the German Army, but who had been captured or deserted to the Allies meant that the Brigade actually grew over time, enabling the strengthening and addition of units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
